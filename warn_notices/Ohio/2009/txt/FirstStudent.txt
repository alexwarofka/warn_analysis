Firstr;Student 6097 Johnstown-Utica Rd. Johnstown, OH 43031 Phone: (740) 967-7533 Fax: (740) 967-7604 June 19, 2009 The Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services 30 E. Broad Street 3200 Floor Columbus, OH 43215 Re: WARN Notice of Plant Closing and/or Mass Layoff To Whom It May Concern: This notice is being provided pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, which requires employers to give official notice to affected employees and the ODJFS of a pending plant closing or mass layoff, as defmed by the Act, at our Johnstown, Ohio facility. This closing may rise to the level necessary to trigger WARN Act notice. First Student is providing this advance, written notice to, among other things, assist the ODJFS in preparing for the upcoming transition. These layoffs resulting from this closing are expected to be permanent, and the entire facility is expected to be closed. Another school bus contractor has been selected to provide transportation services. First Student received notice on June 15, 2009 that the Northridge Local School District has decided not to award the company any routes for the 2009-2010 school year. The loss of this contract effectively ends our business interests in Northridge/Johnstown. As a result of these sudden, unforeseen business circumstances, First Student expects its operations located at 6097 Johnstown-Utica Road, Johnstown, Ohio 43031 to experience a permanent closing. It is anticipated that the closing will occur on approximately June 30, 2009. Another school bus contractor, Petermann School Bus Service, has been selected to provide transportation services for this district. As many as 55 employees may be subjected to a layoff. A list of these employees with their job titles is enclosed. However, it is probable that First Student will have transfer opportunities available for some employees at other facilities, and Petermann School Bus Service will likely have employment opportunities for many of the displaced First Student employees. If you have any questions, please contact me at (513) 761-5136. Sincerely (j)i_~ Rick Kellerman Region Human Resources Manager Enclosure
