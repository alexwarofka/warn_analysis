Supplemental WARN Notice Dear Ms. Canfora: By letter dated November 4, 2008 I advised you of the difficult economic circumstances impacting Empire Iron Mining Partnership and Tilden Mining Company L.C. and of the need to temporarily idle portions of their operations. Additional reductions in demand by the owners and customers of those companies have forced further reductions in planned production beyond what was anticipated at that time. At this time it is unclear how long the additional idling may last, but it is likely to last beyond six months unless there would be an unanticipated upturn in demand due to a rapid economic recovery or some unforeseen event creating additional demand for iron ore from Empire Mine and/or Tilden Mine. Due to this additional downturn in demand additional employees at each location beyond those listed in the November 4, 2008 letter will be laid off on or after March 14, 2009. The names of the additional affected employees who are currently known and their current job titles are shown on the attached schedule. Because of Range Wide bumping rights at Empire Mine and Tilden Mine, employees at each location are affected by reductions in force not only at their own mine but by reductions in force at the other mine. Reductions in force at each location will be made in compliance with the seniority provisions of the August I, 2004 Basic Labor Agreement and Seniority and Posting Agreement, including any changes resulting from the September I, 2008 Settlement Agreement. Benefits for employees laid off will be pursuant to the Basic Labor Agreement, Supplemental Unemployment Benefits Agreement, and Program of Insurance Benefits. The United Steelworkers represent hourly employees at Empire Iron Mining Partnership and Tilden Mining Company L.C.
