At the time of the layoffs we anticipated calling back some employees as early as January 19, 2009 with 200 employees returning on February 9, 2009. Unfortunately, the automotive market has seen an unprecedented further decline in sales with General Motors sales falling 49% in January. The automotive sales figures do not, in our opinion, look promising at least through the 2nd quarter of this year. Based upon our evaluation of extremely low customer demand, we have just completed our re-evaluation of our production needs and have concluded that we will not be able to predict with any degree of certainty that following our next recall on February 16, 2009, that the remaining 119 employees will be recalled within six (6) months of their layoff on January 5, 2009. We also cannot say at this point whether the layoffs will be temporary or permanent. Accordingly, we are providing you with this notice pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification ("WARN") Act as a precautionary step in case the remaining laid off workers are not recalled prior to July 5, 2009. The affected employees are represented by Local IUE-CWA 755: Local IUE-CWA 755 Attn: Shawn Grimes 50 Ovonic Way Springboro, Ohio 45066 Attached to this letter is a listing of the job titles of the positions which may be affected and the number of affected employees in each job group.
