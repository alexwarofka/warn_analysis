The dates of the layoff are incorrect in this notice. The letter states "beginning November 20, 2008 through December 5, 2008". But it should state beginning January 29th, 2009, through March 30, 2009. The Pilots mentioned on this notice will not be furloughed until March 30, 2009. Do I need to resubmit a corrected notice letter or will this email suffice? I apologize for the error and confusion!

Fifth Ave. PO Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216-1618 RE: Mass Layoff at ABX Air, Inc. Dear Ms. Patton: We hereby give you notice that ABX Air, Inc. will conduct a permanent mass layoff at our facility located at 145 Hunter Drive, Wilmington, OH 45177, beginning November 20, 2008 through December 5, 2008. We enclose three lists. The first relates to non-unionized employees and show the job titles of each of the positions that will be eliminated and the number of individuals currently holding those jobs who will be impacted by this mass layoff. Our hourly, non-unionized employees do not have bumping rights. The second list relates to non-unionized exempt and non-exempt salaried employees and shows the job titles of each of the positions that will be eliminated and the number of individuals currently holding those jobs who will be impacted by this mass layoff. These employees also do not have bumping rights. The third list contains similar information concerning the unionized employees. The unionized employees at the facility are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 1224. The President and chief elected officer of Local 1224 is Joe Muckle, 2754 Old State Route 73. These affected, unionized employees are the lowest individuals on the pilot seniority list and, accordingly, do not have bumping rights under the terms of their collective bargaining agreement. This notice is being provided to you pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, which requires employers to give official notice to certain government units or officials of a pending mass layoff.
