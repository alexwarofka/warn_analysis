(440) 238-2210 February 12, 2009 Wendy Patton Rapid Response Administrator Ohio Department of Job and Family Services 4020 E. 5th A venue Columbus, OH 43219 Dear Ms. Patton: Effective 2/12/2009, our Sharon Center plant experienced a layoff due unforeseeable business circumstances, mainly all of our customers decreasing their production schedules and orders by 50% to 75%. We hope this will be a temporary layoff; however that is unforeseeable as well. Due to the unforeseeable business circumstance we were unable to give you prior notice. We provided outplacement assistance via the State of Ohio's Employment Connection and The Ohio Job and Family Services. There is no provision in our policies for transfer, bumping, or reassignment. Effective 2/12/09, 18 Assembly associates, 2 Quality Associates, 3 Shipping associates and 32 Temporary associates have been laid off. We do not have a union at our facility. We are prepared to answer questions and assist in any way it can to ease you through this difficult transition. Please contact Frank Mehwald, President at (440) 238-6931 with questions. Jennifer Dumm Human Resource Partner  1N3~d013J\30 3:JHO..:f>l~OM _·W?
