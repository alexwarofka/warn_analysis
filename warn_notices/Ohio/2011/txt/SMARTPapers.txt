The timing of the layoffs will be dependent upon the volume of customer orders during the wind down period and are expected to be permanent. We had hoped to avoid this action. The US economic slowdown has intensified the effects of reduced commercial demand and the rapid expansion of low-priced Asian coated paper manufacturing, the increased costs of raw materials and chemicals, and the uncertainty on cost requirements of pending EPA legislation have all contributed to the decision to closing the facility. SMART Papers will lay off its employees in three different groupings. The first group (see Attachment I) of employees are expected to be laid off between December 19 and December 30, 2011. A second group (see Attachment II) of employees will be laid off between January 10 and January 24, 2012. The remaining employees (see Attachment Ill) are expected to be laid off between February 15 and February 29, 2012. As noted in the previous paragraph, the exact timing of the layoffs will bedependent on a number of factors, and we will keep you apprised of any anticipated changes . Bargaining Unit employ ees covered under the current labor agreeme nt with USW, Local 1967. The name of the local union official represent ing the bargaining unit employees at Smart Papers is Paul Houston, President, and his contact information is USW , Local 1967, 1050 Millville Avenue , Hamilton , Ohio 45013 , telephone number 513-868-8417 or cell 513.310 .7104 . Y O U'RE  BRI  LLI  A NT .
