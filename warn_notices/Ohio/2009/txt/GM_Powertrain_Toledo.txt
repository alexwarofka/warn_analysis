Fifth Avenue PO Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216-1618 SUBJECT: Notice of a Mass Layoff, Pursuant to the Provisions of the WARN Act, 29 USC 2107(a) Dear Ms. Patton: Pursuant to the provisions of the "Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act" (WARN) you are hereby notified of planned employment reductions in the form of a mass layoff, as defined by the WARN Act, at the General Motors Corporation, Powertrain Division, Toledo Transmission Plant, 1455 W. Alexis Road, Toledo, OH 43612. As the result of unprecedented, dramatic, unforeseen, and continuing decline in customer orders, GM has been forced to cut its production operation. Despite earlier projections that the market would stabilize at a higher production level, GM and other car producers continue to struggle with a continuously diminishing market. As the result of its precipitous decline in sales, GM's very viability is challenged; and, GM has required government assistance to maintain its operations. In the course of seeking assistance, US legislators were intensely critical of the job security protections afforded GM autoworkers. GM has received a federal loan to allow its continuing operations. Consistent with the terms and conditions of the 2009 Federal Loan Guarantee, General Motors has been advised that the International Union, UAW, will eliminate the JOBS Bank effective Monday, February 2, 2009. Therefore, employees who are currently on Protected Status will be placed on indefinite layoff. This very recent agreement has caused GM to immediately issue this WARN Act notice without the normal 60-day notice lead time. An indefinite layoff will occur February 2, 2009. The layoff will affect approximately 63 7 hourly rated employees represented by the United Automobile and Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers (UAW), 8000 East Jefferson, Detroit, Michigan, 48214, Ronald A. Gettelfinger, President. The currently anticipated hourly job classifications and the number of employees to be laid off are attached. Attachment I -UAW classifications and the number of employees who will be laid off pursuant to the Local Seniority Agreement Bumping rights exist for some skilled trades workers. Represented employees laid off by this action may be eligible to receive state unemployment compensation and/or Supplemental Unemployment Benefits in accordance with Exhibit D to the Agreement between General Motors Corporation and the UAW dated September 26, 2007, as may be amended from time to time. If you have any further questions regarding this matter, please contact me at 419-470-5103 or by mail at GMPT Toledo Transmission Plant, 1455 W. Alexis Rd., Toledo, OH 43612. SincerD.ely, , f)~ "--, 6",l'\A-y-' _Vl!:r,--------Josep Farinella Personnel Director l!I
