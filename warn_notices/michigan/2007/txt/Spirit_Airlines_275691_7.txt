Due to operational needs, this closure is now expected to occur on January I, 2008. However, this letter will also serve as notice that eight Detroit based Captains and eight Detroit based First Officers who were originally expected to be displaced on October 1, 2007 will now be displaced on November I, 2007. These sixteen pilots will be displaced pursuant to the terms of section 24 of the Spirit ALPA Collective Bargaining agreement (''CBA"). Specifically, section 24.G.4 of the CBA provides that "when awarding reductions, the Company will offset the reductions by the number of displacees who have been awarded new positions, and award the voluntary displacements first. If reductions still remain. pilots will be involuntarily displaced in reverse seniority order:á All affected employees will be given the option of relocating to Spirit's base in Ft.

In total, 31 Captains and 29 First Officers will now be displaced on October I, 2007. Additionally, two First Officers have already relocated to Ft.

Also, one Detroit Captain originally expected to be displaced on October L 2007 has volunteered to hold a First Otlicer position as of October I, 2007 and will therefore not be displaced on that date (but will he displaced on January l, 2008).
