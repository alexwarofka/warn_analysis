We hopeto accomplish this mass layoff withthe least possible disruption to our employees andthe community. According to the best infonnation available, Gerdau MacSteel will temporarily lay off 299 employees on January 16,2009. A list of the affected positions and the number of affected employees in those positions is attached. (Exhibit A). We are giving less than 60 days' notice because the decline in our business, including the reeent decisions by automobile manufucturersto close assembly plants, has been sudden, dramatic, unexpected, and unforeseen by Gerdau MaeSteel, and outside of Gerdau MacSteel's control. Bumping rights exist under the collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers of America (USW), AFL-CIO-CLC, Local 8339. Certain employees at the facility are represented by the USW, AFL-CIO-CLC, Local 8339 (the "Union").
