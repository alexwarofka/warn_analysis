August 29, 2012 VIA CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED & FACSIMILE Stephanie L. Beckhorn, Manager, WIA Section Workforce Development Agency 201 N. Washington Square Lansing, Michigan 489 l 3 Re: JCIM US, LLC -LAYOFF Dear Ms. Beckhorn: Please beadvised that, on or around September 4, 2012, JCIM US, LLC ("JCIM") will layoff a number of its employees at its Frenchtown 2 facility located at l 833 Frenchtown Center Drive, Monroe, Michigan 48162. The layoffs will take place in two waves, including September 4, 2012, and September lO, 2012. With respect to unrepresented employees, two individuals will be affected and their last day will be August 3 l, 2012, or within two weeks thereafter. The layoff of the two unrepresented employees will be permanent. With regard to the represented employees, all of the layoffs on September 4, 2012, and September 10, 2012, are voluntary and anticipated to be temporary. However, it is possible that some of the employees currently volunteering for layoff will seek to return prior to the end of the layoff and then involuntarily displace another worker (which would amount to an involuntary layoff). To the extent any of the volunteers from the first wave seek to return early, the first layoff date for any displaced workers is anticipated to be September 28, 2012, or within two weeks thereafter. To the extent any of the volunteers from the second wave seek to return early, the first layoff date for any displaced workers is anticipated to be October 5, 2012, or within two weeks thereafter. A list of the affected job titles and number of employees per classification is attached. The majority of these employees are represented by the UAW Local 723. Union inquiries should be directed to Bob Cebina, President, UAW Local 723, 281 Detrnit Avenue, Monroe, Michigan 48162, or via telephone at (734) 241-6005. Due to bumping rights which apply under the labor contract, the employees that end up as affected employees may be in different positions than those identified in the attached list. While the layoffs of the represented employees are voluntary and anticipated to be temporary, JCIM is providing this notice in the event that the nature of the layoffs change. Bumping rights will exist for represented employees. No bumping rights will exist for unrepresented employees. Employees will receive more specific information regarding their last day of employment and benefit information at a later date. For further information regarding this matter, please contact me at JCIM US, LLC, 1833 Frenchtown Center Drive, Monroe, Michigan 48162, or via telephone at (734) 658-4752. Attachment WORKFORCE PFlOGRAMS 4840-1087-6432.1 AFFECTED JOB TITLES & NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES  PER CLASSIFICATION  Date of Anticipated Layoff  Affected Job Title(s)  Number of Employees Per  Classification  August 31, 2012 (or within two weeks thereafter)  1) Production Supervisor 2) Production Coordinator  2) I 3) I  September 28, 2012 (or within two weeks thereafter)  1) Sequencer 2) Molding Operator 3) Material Handler 4) Quality Auditor  1) 3 2) 24 3) 3 4) 1  October 5, 2012 (or within two weeks thereafter)  1) Sequencer  1) IO  4834-3658-6512.1
