Re: 	Conditional Notice Pursuant to the \'(larker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act Dear 1'vfs. Beckham: Hostess Brands, Inc. (including its affiliate Interstate Bi-ands Co1poration, "Hostess" or the "Company") filed for clrnpter 11 relief on January 11, 2012 (the "Filing''). 111e Company has been actively engaged in discussions with various lenders and potential purchasers regarding Hostess' restructuring both before and after the Piling. Our primary focus is to complete our restn1ctt1ring of the Company and emerge from chapter 11 as a viable company. However, it is possible that, despite our best efforts, certain events may occur that would require Hostess to sell all or portions of its business and/ or wind down its operations and liquidate. Despite the uncertainty of what may happen, the federal \X'orker Adjustment and Reu-ain.ing Notification Act and certain related State stah1tes (collectively, "\\' AR.1"\J") generally require employers to prm¥idc advance notice in the event of certain covered employment actions. To comply with any \X1ARN obligations Hostess may have, this letter is intended to give you conditional notice that, based upon the best information reasonably available to Hostess at this time, it is possible that one of the following events may occur: ¥ 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, the pursuit of a sale of all or a 
substantial portion of all of Hostess' assets; 
¥ 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, Hostess to stop pursuing the 
rcstmch1ring of its business; 
¥ 	J\fore than 20% of Hostess' aggregate workforce is laid off after January 11, 2012; ¥ 	Hostess receives an unsatisfactory resolution of its pending motion before the bankruptcy court regarding certain modifications to its collective bargaining agreements with the Bakers and/ or the Teamsters; ¥ 	There is a strike, walkout, lockout, slowdown or other work stoppage that is likely to have a material adverse effect on Hostess; or ¥ 	Hostess seeks bankruptcy court approval to commence a sale of property while in bankruptc}' which accounts for more than 20% of Hostess' consolidated net sales as reported on Hostess' financial statements for the twelve-month period preceding January á11,2012. 6031 Connection Drive, Irving, TX 75039 -(972} 532-4500 If one of these events occms, Hostess may begin the process of permanently ceasing operations, and significantly scaling down operations at its Bay City ZvIT-824 N Euclid located at 2059 North Euclid Ave, Bay City, :tvll48706, as early as 60 days from the receipt of this notice. In such an event, Hostess currently expects substantially all employee separations to occur witliin 60 days of the receipt of this notice or within a 14-day period thereafter. At the end of this process, the entire Bay City ivll -824 N Euclid would be pennanently dosed. TI1ere willbe no bumping rights available to employees in tliis circumstance. A listing of the job titles of the positions that we would expect to be affected, and tl1e names of the employees 111 each of those job classifications is attached as Attachment A. Some of the affected employees are represented by one of the twelve unions listed below.
