December 2, 2008 Ms. Chong-Anna Canfora Director Rapid Response Section Michigan Department of Labor & Economic C'Jl'owth Fax: 517.373.4648 611 West Ottawa Street, 4th Floor P.O. Box 30004 Lansing, Michigan 48909 Re: Notification of layoffs at Ventura Manufacturing Dear Ms. Canfora: This letter is to inform your office of a planned layoff by Ventura Manufacturing in Zeeland, Michigan. We do not believe that notice of this reduction in force is required under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act as we do not anticipate that we will cut the requisite number of jobs under WARN. However, since the market is so unsteady and we simply cannot predict the future, we are providing our employees with advance notice as encouraged by Section 7 of WARN. The employment site for which the reduction in force is planned is located at 471 East Roosevelt, Zeeland, Michigan 49464. As a part of the reduction in force, layoffs began on November 19, 2008 (13 people were effected at that time). Due to further unanticipated volume reductions, we will be laying off more people starting December 3, 2008 ( approximately 22 people). Again, as of today, another customer cancelled another week of production v.1thout notice. If customers continue to unexpectedly cancel orders, we'll have to do another set of layoffs 60 days from now (February I, 2009). Because we anticipate that these layoffs will last six months or longer, we are unable to provide a timetable for future recalls. Greater advance notice was not given because of the unforeseeable business circumstances provision in WARN Act, due to the sudden downturn in the economy and, specifically, order cancellations by large customers who we anticipated would weather the downturn better. For further information, please contact Michael Dowker at 616-836-2578. Sincerely, Ventura Manufacturing, Inc. By~~.:r RECEIVED Its D. +..._ .F ~~--11-.,...... DEC08 2008 RAPIDHt.SPONSE WORKFORCEPROGRAMS ¥ . c,) \\!, 1á STATE OF MICHIGAN JENNIFER M.
