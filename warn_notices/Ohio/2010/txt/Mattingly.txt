The Service-First Family March 16, 2010 C-: ... -á r-~; :.,-" : _} c-.NOTICE TO RAPID RESPONSE SECTION, BUREAU 011WIA,-' omo DEPARTMENT OF JOB & FAMILY SERVI@S :_J OF MASS LAYOFF á-á á, C") Pursuant to Section 2102(aXl) of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Section 2101, et~, Mattingly Foods, Inc. hereby gives notice to Rapid Response Section, Bureau of WIA, Ohio Department of Job & Family Services of its intention to lay off workers at its 302 State Street, Zanesville, Ohio, facility, as a result of the sudden and unforeseen loss of major customers that comprised essentially all of the facility's business. Specifically, Bob Evans informed Mattingly Foods on February 18, 2010 of its decision to have its business serviced by a distributor other than Mattingly Foods, and Steak & Shake's distribution contract with Mattingly Foods was not renewed on March 1, 2010. Negotiations with these customers as to transition was necessary in order to determine when resulting layoffs would occur. Those negotiations were completed on March 5, 2010. Upon completion of a transition period following these cancellations, nearly all employees will have been or will be laid off. The planned layoffs are expected to be permanent and will occur at the facility located at 302 State Street, Zanesville, Ohio. Additional information about the layoffs is available by calling Mr. Rick Barnes at (740) 454-0136. His address is 302 State Street, Zanesville, Ohio 43701. The layoffs are expected to be staggered. Due to unpredictable transitional business needs, Mattingly Foods is á currently unable to identify precisely when --~--~.these separations will occur, but they are generally expected to begin May 17, 2010 and continue through May 30, 2010. At this point, the first separation is expected to occur May 17, 2010. Mattingly Foods is providing as much notice as possible of this first separation, although it is not required to provide a full 60 days' notice due to the "unforeseeable business circumstances" exception under Section 3(b)(2)(A) of WARN. Mattingly Foods has prepared the following tentative layoff schedule for expected separations based on the best information available at this point in time. Because of unknown transition factors, and because those employees holding the job title(s) of Driver, Mechanic, Maintenance, Dispenser Technician, Warehouse, and Janitor are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which permits senior employees to volunteer for layoff, Mattingly Foods cannot accurately predict who will be laid off during each separation. No employee has bwnping rights. Given all of these considerations, we have listed below and on the Attachment hereto the job titles of all personnel. However, since we currently expect that a few employees will remain actively employed beyond May 30, 2010, we have chosen to identify this event as a mass layoff, rather than a plant closing, and have not stated herein that the entire facility is to beclosed. Column A Job Titles Affected  ColumnB Nwnber of Employees in Respective Job Title Affected  ColmnnC Expected Separation 14-day Window Period for Employees Holding Colmnn B Job titles  Driver  122 , ..
