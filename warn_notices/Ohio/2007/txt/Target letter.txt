Dear Mr. Turner: This letter is to notify you that on July 24, 2007, Target will be relocating its Cuyahoga County store, located at 20001 Center Ridge Road, Rocky River, Ohio 44116, to a new store located at 20900 Westgate, Fairview Park, Ohio 44126. As a result, Target intends to permanently close its store at 20001 Center Ridge Road, on July 24, 2007. During the next few months, we will be working with the approximately 190 affected non-exempt employees at the Cuyahoga County store to offer them employment opportunities in our new store at 20900 Westgate. Because all of our Cuyahoga County employees will be offered employment at the new store at 20900 Westgate, we do not anticipate that any will be involuntarily separated. Attachment A enumerates the affected job titles and the number of affected employees in each classification. Any involuntary separations that do become necessary will begin on July 24, 2007. The affected employees are not represented by a union. There will be no bumping rights. This notice is being given to you pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 2101, et. ~ A list of the affected employees by job title which includes the employees' termination dates will be available at the Cuyahoga County store. For further information or coordination of assistance, please contact me at the above Target address or telephone me at (859) 282-2980. 4~~> Angela French Regional Human Resources Representative LO:6 ,.,~ I I UdV Lffil G494 Human Resources #529534 1090 Hansel Avenue, Florence, KY 41042 ATTACHMENT A
