Leggitt Company, located at 450 Leggitt Road, Marshall, Michigan, 49068, will be laying off employees for at least six (6) months. Please note that at this time, Marshall Brass does not intend to close entirely. Currently, forty-seven (47) employees are currently on temporary layoff and the Company had expected to be able to recall those employees in the near future. Importantly, although the Company would have preferred to provide employees with sixty (60) days advance notice as required by the WARN Act, it has just become clear that the current temporary layoffs are likely permanent, or at least will last longer than six (6) months. Moreover, although the Company is not able at this time to specifically identify any additional layoffs, it is possible that additional employees may also be laid off on a permanent and/or long-term basis. Marshall Brass Company regrets that these long-term layoffs must occur. However, over eighty percent (80%) of the Company's business is directly connected to the housing market. The unpredictable, severe and significant decline in the housing market has caused an unexpected and unforeseen reduction in_orders of two (2) key customers, Viega and Uponor. This loss of business has resulted in excessive inventories and diminished production requirements and caused the temporary layoffs to become permanent and/or long.term. Under the WARN Act, the sixty (60) day notice period may be shortened due to such unforeseen business circumstances. The temporary layoffs mentioned above occurred on April 21, June 17, June 23, June 26, July 7, July 15, and July 21, 2008. Listed below is an itemization of the positions affected and the number of employees in each position: Jul 29 08 12:02p Marshall Brass Hr Departm 2697816226 Position AA Set Up Operator AA Set Up Operator AA Set Up Operator A Set Up Operator A Set Up Operator B Operator .
