We first notified you of this closing in December 2009 ( copy of notice attached). Some of the employees employed at that facility are not represented by a union, but others are represented by Teamsters Local No. 7 (President Dave Green), whose offices are at 3330 Miller Road, Kalamazoo, Michigan. There are to be 55 employees to be laid off, with the layoffs occurring in accordance with the attached schedule. No bumping rights exist among those non-union employees, nor are there any jobs to which those employees may bump. Bumping rights exist for the employees represented by Teamsters Local No. 7, but because the entire facility is closing, there are no jobs to which those employees may bump. The job titles of all employees expected to be laid off are indicated on the attached schedule. Further info1mation about this closing may be obtained from Renee Shull.
