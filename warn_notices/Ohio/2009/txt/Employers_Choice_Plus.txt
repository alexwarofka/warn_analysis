Manufacturing Company, Uc Account# 1461679009. We intend to idle both 
companies in varies forms. Some will be laid off indefinitely others on reduced 
hours beginning immediately. 
Economic conditions beyond our control have resulted in a severe reduction in 
orders that we could not have reasonably foreseen. As a result, an indefinite 
idling of operations are unavoidable. This unexpected nature of the reduction 
in orders has prevented us from giving more notice of the layoffs. 
It is anticipated that the idlings will affect approximately 150 employees, with as 
many as 80 being on layoff at a time during the period. 
Because of the uncertainty in the market, we are unable to predict exactly when 
Employees may be recalled. 
If you need any further information please contact me at 513-755-7719. ~ely, /1u~Ci-~ Trish A.
