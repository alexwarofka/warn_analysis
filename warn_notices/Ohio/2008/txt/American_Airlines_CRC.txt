Jones-Kelley Ohio Department of Job & Family Services Rapid Response Section, Bureau of WIA 4020 E. Fifth Avenue Columbus, OH 43219 Re: Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act Notice Dear Ms. Jones-Kelley: As you know, during the past several years American has been seriously challenged by a number of adverse economic conditions. We are working hard to help American return to profitability and ensure our long-term competitiveness in accordance with the Turnaround Plan launched by our CEO. In October of 2007 we were notified that the Bartlett Building located at 15400 E. 4th Street in Cincinnati, Ohio will close, requiring American Airlines and other tenants to vacate the premises. After much thought and consideration the decision has been made to close the Central Reservations Office (CRO) which occupies several floors of the Bartlett Building. The closure is effective on August 15, 2008. We have offered CRO employees several options as a result of the closure of the reservations office. Those options include positions as home based reservations sales representatives, 5 and 10 years extended leave packages, relocations and layoff options. Regrettably, there may be employees who suffer an "employment loss" as defined by WARN. Although there are approximately 477 employees at the CRO, at this point in time we do not know how many employees may suffer employment loss, because the options mentioned earlier in this letter will allow employees to make plans as early as February, 2008. Our Cincinnati Reservations Office is located at the following address: American Airlines Central Reservations Office 1500 E. 4th Street Cincinnati, Ohio 45202 Should there be any involuntary reductions in force it will be governed by the applicable terms of any collective bargaining agreements and/or corporate policy, including the seniority lists and any provisions regarding "bumping rights." At this time, the closure of the Central Reservations Office is expected to be permanent. 4333 Amon Carter Boulevard, MD5575, Fort Worth, Texas 76155 817-967-1575, Fax 817-967-1477, kevin.cox@aa.com This letter contains'a11 relevant information that we have at this time. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Tiffany Schildge at 817 963-7684. Sincerely, State and Community Affairs
