The planned action is expected to be permanent and constitutes a "plant closing" under the WARN Act. We have been unable to provide you with additional advance notice of this action because of unforeseeable business circumstances.

The affected employees are not represented by any labor organization and there are no applicable bumping rights. However, certain employees may be offered the opportumty to transfer to other employment with the Company. At present, the Company does not know which, if any, employees may be offered this option. The termination dates for the employees to be laid off are expected to begin l Oil9/07 and continue through 12/31/07. Information concerning the job titles of positions to be affected, the number of affected employees in each job classification, and the anticipated schedule for making separations will be kept on file at the Company. The name, address and telephone number of the Company official to contact for further information is Blake Herring, Human Resources Vice President, GMAC ResCap, 8400 Normandale Boulevard, Suite 250, Minneapolis, MN 55437, (952) 857,6556. Sincerely, B~~ Human Resources Vice President RECEIVED NOV13 ZOO/ RAPIDRESPONSE WORKFORCEPROGRAMS
