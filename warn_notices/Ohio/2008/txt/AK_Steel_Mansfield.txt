Front Street Columbus. Ohio 43216-1618 Re: 	Notification of Layoffs at Mansfield Works, 913 Bowman Street, Mansfield, Ohio, 44903 Dear Sir or Madam: Due to the recent major and unanticipated downturn in the United States and global economy, and the resultant sharply lower demand for the plant's products, AK Steel Corporation plans to temporarily idle operations at the Mansfield Works. Based upon reasonably foreseeable business conditions, we currently expect that the plant will remain idled until early-to-mid-January 2009. In light, however, of the significant uncertainties which continue to be present in the economy, andthe dramatic and rapid impact that changes in the economy have had on the steel industry recently, we cannot be certain of the duration of this action. Tiris notice is based upon the bestinfon:nation available to the Company as ofthis date and is being provided as promptly as practicable in light of the extraordinary and rapidly declining business circumstances which have led to these layoffs. Toe layoffs resulting from this curtailment of operations at Mansfield Works began effective November 9, 2008. Attached is a list of the job titles of positions affected by the layoffs and the number of employees currently holding those affected. positions. Layoffs have and will continue to be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, including the bumping rights that exist under th(:Agreement Employees at the Mansfield Works affected by this temporary curtail.roent in operations are represented by the United Steel Workers. The President of the local union is Ron Davis and bis contact information is: Mr. Ron Davis, President, USWA Local 169, 376 Longview Avenue West, Mansfield, Ohio 44903, (419) 522.8103. We remain hopeful that we will be able to return our dedicated and hard-working Mansfield Works employees to their jobs as soon as possible. The timing of their return, however, depends upon business conditions which we simply cannot presently foresee and which are beyond our control. {00003807 V 2} LEGALAKSTEEL Fax 513-d25-5607 Nov 11 2008 04;50pm P003/004 ~I( Steel Corporation Should you seek additional information concerning these layoffs, please feel free to contact me at 513-425-2826. sá ~ely,j ...., !-( i ' .jt.r-r! , ('(\cj AlanMcCoy Vice President Government and Public Relations {0000~07 V 2} LEGALAKSTEEL Fax 513-d25-560?
