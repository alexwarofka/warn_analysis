(the "Company") located at 324 4th Avenue, Tiffin, Ohio 44883, The Company has determined that business conditions require this closing. It is expected that this closing will occur no later than 60 days from the date of this notice. Should layoffs occur before that date, affected employees will receive the wages and benefits they would have earned during that period, to the extent required by WARN. The attached exhibit reflects all job classifications at this facility that will be affected by a shutdown, and the number of employees in each job classification. Bargaining unit employees are represented by Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics & Allied Workers AFL-CIO, CLC Local 7A located at 240 N. Washington Street, Tiffin, Ohio 44883 and the chief elected official of that Union is Ronald E. Fatzinger, who may be reached at ( 419) 447-2171. There are no transfer, bumping or relocation rights for non-bargaining unit employees. Bumping rights (if any) for bargaining unit employees will be governed by the current labor agreement, but are unlikely to apply in the circumstances of a closing. Your office will be advised of additional information concerning the closing and any other developments that might affect the Tiffin facility, as required by WARN. Should you have any questions or wish to discuss this announcement, please contact Randy Swander at ( 419) 443-3282 or ( 419) 618-213 7. Sincerely, Warren "Mickey" Blanks Vice President, Human Resources Department  Job Classification  Bargaining  Employees  Current depa11mental positions  msy nuctustfl  from one depal1ment to another ss monthly  msnufscturlng  requirements  sre determined .
