Box 1618 Columbus, Ohio 43216 Dear Ms. Maybriar: This letter is to inform you that AISS, a Sterling Infosystems Company, will be conducting mass layoffs at its Independence facility which will result in employee separations commencing on March 6, 2012. All affected employees work out of the Company's facility located at 6111 Oak Tree Blvd, Independence, OH 44131. 38 employees in total will be affected. This action is expected to be permanent. There are no bumping rights. If you require further information, you may contact me at 646-485-6635. This notice is being provided as a courtesy since the number of employees impacted may not meet the threshold for requiring notice. As such, by providing this notice AISS is not waiving any right to assert that some or all of the potential separations do not require sixty (60) days notice under federal law. Sincerely, ns. !nc~ 249 \/Vf'f-~;t~ /t(¥ ~:;1ree< / ;\JPVJ\((}rk ~Jyá i 0011 te!:212?365-tJO I fax:212736
