Ottawa Street, 4"' Floor RAFIDRESPONSELansing, Michigan 48933 WORKFORCEPROGRAMS Dear Ms. Canfora: This notice is being given pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988. Nicholas Plastics, LLC, will be permanently closing its entire facility located at 11700 48"' Avenue, Allendale, Michigan 49401-0136. This permanent closing will result in a permanent layoff at the facility of approximately l 03 employees. This plant closing is occurring because of unforeseen economic conditions (in particular, the extraordinary decrease in demand for cars andtrucks), and the inability to obtain additional financing from Nicholas Plastics' lender and additional commitments from General Motors and other customers. In this regard, Nicholas Plastics has been actively seeking additional capital and business which would have permitted the Company to avoid lhis closing. However, Nicholas Plastics was recently informed that its lender is not willing lo provide additional funding and Nicholas Plastics was unable to secure additional customer ccmmitments. Less than sixty (60) days' ootice is being given of the plant closing because of these extraordinary cond.il.ions. Currently, Nicholas Plastics is negotiating with its bankto determine the best. next steps. Because of these negotiations, it is unclear as to when the plant closing will occur. The closing may begin as early as this week, or within fourteen (14) days of this date, and may continue over the next sixty ( 60) days. Although Nicholas Plastics will continue to pursue other options, we believe this notice is appropriate at this time. Nicholas Plastics will provide additional information as to when the plant closing will occur and when employees will be laid off as soon as such infonnation is available. Attached is a list of the job classifications and the number of employees in each job classification that will be affected. There may be bumping rights applicable, but only to the extent that the actual closing occurs over a period of time. As noted above, that will depend on the actions of the bank and customers. Some affected employees are .represented by Chicago andMidwest Regional Joint Board, UNITE HERE.
