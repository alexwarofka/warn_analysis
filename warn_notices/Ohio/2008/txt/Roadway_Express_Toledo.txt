NOTICE Subject to approval by the National Change of Operations Committee at the hearing scheduled for on or about January 26, 2009 of the Change in Operations dated December 28, 2008, the facility identified below will have layoffs. To the extent that this event qualifies as a "mass layoff' as defined by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. 2101, et seq., and the United States Department of Labor Final Interpretive Rule, 20 C.F.R. Part 639 ("WARN"), this notice qualifies as your WARN notice. 1. The facility experiencing layoffs is: Roadway Express -Toledo, OH 6180 Hagman Road Toledo, OH 43612 2. For further information, you may contact: Howard Mosier, Area Director of Operations Office -330.665.0218 3. It is expected that the layoffs will be permanent. 4. It is expected that the layoffs will take place and employment terminations will commence on March 1, 2009 and for the two week period thereafter. 5. Attached to this Notice are the job titles of the positions to be affected by the closing and the number of employees estimated to be affected in each job classification. 6. Some of the affected employees are represented by a union. Due to employees' rights to exercise their seniority and bump under the Collective Bargaining Agreement and the upcoming decision of the Change in Operations Committee, it is impossible to determine now how many union employees from this facility will ultimately be laid off. Among other complicating factors, it is expected the employees from other Company facilities will have the right to bump into this facility. Therefore, additional union employees may be affected. The Company will continue to work with the Union to identify the proper application of the seniority and bumping procedure to identify those employees who will actually be laid off. The names and addresses of the unions, along with their chief elected officials are as follows: Mr. James Hoffa, President International Brotherhood of Teamsters 25 Louisiana Ave., NW Washington, DC 20001-2198 Mr. Bill Lichtenwald Teamster Local Union No. 20 435 South Hawley Street Toledo, OH 43609 7. There is no prov1s10n in the Company's policy for transfer, bumping, or reassignment for non-union office or management personnel. Some affected non-union employees may, however, be offered the opportunity to transfer to another Company location. nt & Litigation Counsel December 28, 2008 Attachments ¥ List of Job Titles and Number of Affected Employees LIST OF JOB TITLES AND #'S OF AFFECTED EE'S
