Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216-1618 Dear Mr. Turner: KeyCorp is implementing certain strategic actions to improve its productivity and operating efficiency. Specifically KeyCorp is closing its call center and help desk operations in a Dayton, Ohio location and consolidating operations into other centers across the United States. Regrettably, this action will necessitate the loss of jobs at a "WARN" site in the State of Ohio. Accordingly, KeyCorp, which includes its affiliated subsidiaries for purposes hereof, may experience a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. ¤ 2101 e.tseq. (the "Act"), at the following employment site in the State of Ohio: 34 North Main Street Dayton, Ohio 45402 KeyCorp anticipates that a total of 185 employees may experience an "employment loss" at the above site beginning on January 1, 2008 and ending December 31, 2008. Please note that the actual number of affected employees is expected to be less due to normal employee attrition and our internal reassignment program. KeyCorp has long maintained a tradition of concern for employees and every effort is being made to assist employees where appropriate positions are unavailable through our internal reassignment program. Additionally, KeyCorp is offering outplacement programs to assist individuals in their career search and with specific skills such as resume writing and interview preparation. Employees whose positions are being eliminated are being provided separation pay and other benefits for which they qualify. {00219821 vi PUBLIC) Mr. Jim Turner November 1 , 2007 Page 2 KeyCorp remains deeply committed to all of our employees and communities, and we would be pleased to answer any questions you may have concerning this matter. Kindly direct your inquiries to Katie Ladd, Human Resources, (216) 689-0812. Please acknowledge your receipt of this letter by signing and returning the enclosed copy in the envelope provided for your convenience. Sincerely, KEY CORP By: 	~ Thomas E.
