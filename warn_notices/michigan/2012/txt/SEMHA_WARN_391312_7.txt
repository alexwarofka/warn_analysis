Cieszynski Executive Director June 25, 2012 The Honorable David Bing Mayor of the City of Detroit 2 Woodward A venue Suite 1126 Detroit MI 48226 Dear Mr.Mayor: The WARN applicability to the Southeastern Michigan Health Association,s (SEMHA's) current situation is not certain for reasons stated ábelow, and SEMHA does not waive such determination, but nonetheless provides the WARN-compliant information: The_ Southeastern Michigan Health Association (SEMHA) a non profit 501 (c)(3) corporation is hereby providing notification that on May 15, 2012 the senior leadership of the Detroit Health & Wellness Promotion (DHWP) department of the City of Detroit announced to our staff(l02 individuals-See Attachment) that contractual services with SEMI-IA will end September 30, 2012. Accordingly, those 102 SEMHA employees located at DHWP have been notified by SEMHA that their employment willend on that date as well. SEMHA is not a party to any coHective bargaining agreement and its policies do not provide for bumping. It is undisputed that all SEMHA employees are hired with the knowledge and must acknowledge that their employment with SEMHA ends if the underlying grant funds (i.e., contract) end such as by c01itract (exhaustion, nonrenewal, etc.), For this reason, WARN applicability to SEMHA employ~es is uncertain. Nonetheless SEMHA has already given its affected employees located at DHWP, 1151 Taylor Street, Detroit MI 48202 notice of impeding separation. SEMHA's notice, incidentally, complies with all of the WARN requirements (Attachment). SEMHA further states that in giving this alternative notice it will keep accessible all other information outlined in WARN and provide it to the State Rapid Response Dislocated Worker Unit and local government upon request. If you have additional q1,1estions or concerns please contact me at the telephone number located at the top of this stationery. Sincerely, ~?-~ Thomas J.
