III LANEi,. IHOSPITALITY ~ -"" ,;I"~ .,J., October 15, 2008 N.. Na:,Jim Turner Chief, Rapid Response Section Ohio Department of Job and Family Services 4020 E. 5th A venue Columbus, OH 43219 Re: Toledo Crowne Plaza Hotel Dear Mr. Turner: This letter will serve as official notice that Lane Hotels, Inc. will shut down and cease all operations at the Toledo Crowne Plaza Hotel ("Hotel"), located at 444 N. Summit Street, Toledo, OH 43604. As a result, we will implement layoffs of approximately 146 individuals, which represents all individuals who are employed at the Hotel. The layoff of 146 individuals will be implemented on Friday, November 14, 2008 and all separations will occur on that date or within fourteen (14) days thereafter. The layoffs will be permanent and thus will exceed six ( 6) months in duration. Since all employees will be laid off, it is anticipated that there will be no "bumping," or other forms of transfer or reassignment of personnel. Because the Hotel is owned by Paradise Hospitality, Inc. ("Paradise"), we have no knowledge of Paradise's plans with respect to the Hotel or whether the laid off employees will be offered jobs by Paradise or any other employer after this permanent layoff. Accordingly, employees are receiving notification in accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S. C. section 2101 et seq.) ("the WARN Act"). Employees are being provided with 30 days (rather than 60 days) notice due to business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the time that notice would have been required under the WARN Act. Specifically, despite its contractual obligations and verbal assurances to the contrary, Paradise has dramatically and unexpectedly rendered our performance of our obligations at the Hotel pursuant to our Management Agreement impossible. Paradise's actions giving rise to this situation include, but are not limited to, its failure to pay sums which are due and owing and its failure to provide sufficient funds for the timely payment of vendors and for the reasonable operation of the Hotel. Copies of the layoff notices, which will be provided to employees, are attached. There are no represented employees at the facility. Attached is a list of the job titles that will be affected by the layoffs and the number of affected employees in each of the job classifications. Une Lane Center, 1200 Shermer [foad ¥ Northbrook, Illinois 60062 847/498-6650 ¥ FAX 847/498-2104 www.lanehospitality.com You may direct any further inquiries regarding this situation to Debra Stinson, Vice President of Human Resources at 847/291-5764. Very truly yours, ~ Bill DeForrest
