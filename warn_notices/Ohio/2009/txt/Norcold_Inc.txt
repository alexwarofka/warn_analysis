Re: Norcold, lnc.-WARN Notice Dear Ms. Patton: Norcold, Inc. ("Norcold") operates a plant in Sidney, Ohio, manufacturing products later used by Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs") in the Recreational Vehicle business. Between September 20, 2008, and November 8, 2008, Norcold laid off approximately 31 employees due to lack of business and an additional 14 in the office as part of a major reorganization of our business . Because the overall number of jobs affected was relatively small in relation to the total number of employees, no WARN Act notice was required or given. Later, in November 2008, Norcold was informed by its OEMs that due to the deteriorating economy they were going to shut down their plants for a number of weeks, exceeding their normal holiday shutdown schedule. As a consequence, over the following few weeks, Norcold was forced to lay off approximately 99 employees. Because these layoffs were separate and distinct from the layoffs in September, October and early November, and because the layoffs were expected to last just a number of weeks (i.e., there was no expected employment loss under the Act), no WARN Act notice was required or given. Consistent with this expectation, approximately 11 employees were recalled from lay off in December 2008 and 53 more in January 2009. We kept our employees informed regarding their status by sending them an updated letter on December 16, 2008 . Unfortunately, in the last week it has come to Norcold's attention that the worsening economy may lengthen the current layoffs. For example, Norcold's OEMs have now informed us that their plant shutdowns will be longer than anticipated . While Norcold is hopeful that the layoffs which commenced in November will continue to be temporary , and that most employees will be recalled in the Spring, Norcold is now taking a conservative approach, and is giving its employees notice under the WARN Act. Therefore, in accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act, 29 U.S.C. ¤ 2010, et seq., you are hereby notified, as the responsible official of the State of Ohio ! h .. áuátlrd t ,,rpura ti\Hl f' t ) _ [{, 1_\ l~X_-;_ \n n .\rh (,r. \lic h;~~in -tS lilh ¥ Ph~HlC. ~.t-J "76'J t,U01i ¥ Jád,\. ;_i.-4 ?r)q .~o} _:. \,:t¥ry,áiJd hk , {,qO '--ko t!Kr Rn.;1ll.

Due to the belief that the numbers were inadequate to trigger the requirement of the WARN notice, and the belief that most of the layoffs would be temporary, no advance notice was given to the employees. The following jobs have been impacted: PERMANENT DATE 10/15/08 01/01/09 TITLE NUMBER Shipping Supervisor 1 Manufacturing Engineer 1 Manufacturing Engineering Technician 1 Manager, Warranty & Reliability 1 Prototype/Tooling Technician 1 Prototype Technician 1 Design Engineer 1 Administrative Assistant, Engineering 1 Program Manager 1 Manager, Compressor Engineering Group & Engineering Services 1 Senior Buyer 1 Quality Repair Technician 1 Sr. Design Engineer 2 Warranty Claim Processor 3 Technical Service Representative 3 TEMPORARY DATE TITLE NUMBER 9/20/08 Production Operative II 16 10/14/08 Production Operative II 3 10/15/08 Production Operative II 1 Production Operative Ill 1 Maintenance Technician 1 11/8/08 Production Operative II 9 11/13/08 Production Operative II 5 Production Operative Ill 3 rhd!c,rd C urptlr:n11tn.

There is no expectation that the employees under the "permanent" column will be recalled.

We look forward to working with your office to assist our employees in securing any available benefits or relief. This letter is intended to comply fully with the WARN Act.
