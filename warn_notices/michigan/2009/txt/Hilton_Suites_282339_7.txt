This action is expected to be permanent. Hilton Hotels Corporation will no longer be managing the Hotel at his location. The employee separations are expected to occur on June 30, 2009 and we expect that there will be 64 affected employees. Detailed information regarding the affected employees is maintained on premises. There are no bumping rights at this location. You may contact Sheri Takacs at 248-322-2302 for further information. We note that this notice is being provided as a courtesy since Hilton Suites has never employed !00 employees and accordingly is not covered by the WARN Act. Further, it is our sincere hope that the far majority of separating employees will be rehired by the new management company and accordingly would not have suffered an employment Joss. Very truly yours, r.~ Regional Director of Human Resources Hilton Hotels Corporation -East Region 2300 Featherstone Road, Auburn Hill~ MI 43326 Tel, 248 334 2222 I/ax, 248 322 2321 Offu:inl SJ, 1uor of lltP U.S. Oly11tpir: Tr.tun Rescrvatioui,: www.hUton.com ot' 1-800-HICroNS
