Act, at Harco Mfg. Group, LLC, 3535 Kettering Blvd. Moraine, OH 45439. On Thursday, April 23, General Motors notified Harco of a significant reduction in its production schedule, directly affecting its order with Harco. Because of this sudden and unforeseen business circumstance, production schedules at Harco will be immediately reduced to be aligned with our customer requirements. Although Harco was in the process of returning employees on temporary layoff to their positions, returning employees to work will now not be possible due to the GM cut in its production schedule. The GM production schedule reduction will result in the immediate conversion of the temporary lay offs to a permanent layoff of 106 positions. These positions do not have bumping rights. 3535 Kettering Blvd. ¥ Moraine, Ohio 45439 ¥ Phone (937) 528-5000 ¥ FAX (937) 528-5091 The currently anticipated job classifications and numbers of employees to be laid off are attached.
