Magna Steyr L.L.C. ("M.S.L.L.C.") has found it necessary to lay off all employees from their positions at the paint facility located at 3800 Stickney Avenue, Toledo , Ohio 43608. M.S.L.L.C.'s contract to operate the facility will be terminated and Chrysler Group LLC will take over management of the facility on a permanent basis. Although we hope that there may be other employment opportunities for some employees, these layoffs must be considered permanent. The layoffs will affect 213 employees. Exact dates of the layoffs have not been determined, but the first layoff is expected to occur on February 28, 2011 and the lay offs will continue through March 13, 2011. To the extent that these layoffs constitute a "mass layoff' or "plant closing" under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, this letter is intended to fulfill the Act's requirements. By providing this letter, however, M.S.L.L.C. does not concede that the Act applies or that notices are otherwise required. For further information, please contact me at 419-729-6275. ~ours, Ronda May~ Human Resource Manager "':'":.r,сс . . ; сс с C. ~) 3800 Stickney Ave. е Toledo, Ohio 43608 е (419) 729.6250 Main е (419) 729.6249 Fax
