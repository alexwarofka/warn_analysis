Washington Square Lansing, Michigan 48913 Dear Ms. Hennessey: I regret to infonn you that USA Jet Airlines, Inc. located at 2068 E Street Belleville, MI 48111will experience a mass layoff or plant closing as those tenns are defined in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, 29 USC ¤ 210 I et seq and the Company will pennanently layoff the employees in the job categories listed in the attachment, effective December 2, 2008. This notice is being provided to you in accordance with the terms of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, 29 USC ¤ 2101 et seq. Pursuant to 29 USC 2102(a)(3), USA Jet Airlines is providing as much notice as is practicable, but less than 60 days, due to business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time that notice would have been required, including the sudden and significant decrease in automotive.related cargo charter volumes coinciding with the steep automotive industry decline and the loss of a major passenger charter customer. Further, additional capital that would have allowed USA Jet to avoid or postpone this reduction in force did not materialize in the time that was necessary to avoid the reduction and USA Jet was not able to provide additional notice because it reasonably and in good faith believed that such notice would have precluded the investment of outside capital. A list of all employee ,;b:,sifi¥:atbns affacted by thi;: p'~nt -:l0sing is attached. There are no bumping rights available for the affected employees and the tennination is pennanent. If you need further information regarding the layoffs you can contact me at 2068 E Street Belleville, Ml 48111, phone (734) 547-7200. RECEIVED f.tv/(!Zff DEC052008D aid E. cNeff 7 orporate Counsel Vice President, Administration RAPID RESPONSE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS LJS.f\Je1 J:..1ri1n:::>_ _/Ut:8 E )1ree1 B011i2v1v::"li::1i 1;nr 11;1:. 734-54/ /2Q(1 Job Titles Number of Employees Pilots 31 Technical Services Employees¥ 42 Flight Operations Personnel 13 Flight Attendants 12 á ~ l,f'D .i ¥ Technical Services employees include mechanics, quality control personnel, stockroom personnel, ground support personnel, avionics personnel and technical services department clerical and administrative personnel.
