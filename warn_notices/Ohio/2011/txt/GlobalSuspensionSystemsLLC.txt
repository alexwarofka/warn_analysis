Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216-1618 Dear Ms. Maybriar: In our letter of November 30, 2010, we advised you that Global Suspension Systems, LLC had developed plans to close its facility located at 721 East Edgerton Street, Bryan, OH 43506. You were advised that in accordance with the Company's tentative plans, employment separations at the facility were expected to begin during a 14-day period beginning on February 25, 2011 and would continue thereafter. The entire facility is expected to be closed permanently as a result of these plans. We have prepared this letter to supplement and update our August 1, 2011 letter to you and to inform you that the employment separations which were expected to occur during a 14-day period beginning on September 1, 2011 are now expected to occur during a 14-day period beginning on September 30, 2011. Other, subsequent layoffs are anticipated consistent with the schedule on Attachment A. In contrast, the first group of employment separations scheduled to occur on or about February 25, 2011, have gone forward as scheduled previously. This information is being provided at present because our customer orders for service parts have developed into lifetime buys causing additional schedule increases. The above dates are based upon the information currently available. We will inform you of any changes in those plans or if additional information becomes available. The job titles of the positions which are now scheduled to be eliminated during the 14-day period beginning on September 30, 2011 and other, subsequent layoffs are listed in Attachment A to this letter. The United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union AFL-CIO, CLC (USW), Local No. 1-108 represents some of the employees who will be affected by the Company's plans, which have been described in separate letters forwarded to John Rensberger, Union President, 06296 Coy Rd, Ney, OH 43549. Bumping rights for USW-represented employees are governed by the parties' collective bargaining agreement and other agreements. Bumping rights are not available for non-union employees. If you have any questions or desire additional information, please contact Stan Lowe, Human Resources Manager, 721 E. Edgerton St. Bryan, OH 43506, 419-630-2507. с Very truly yours,
