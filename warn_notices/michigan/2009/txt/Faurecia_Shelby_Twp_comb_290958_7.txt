Dear Ms. Canfora: This letter is written pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification ("WARN") Act, 29 U.S.C. ¤ 2101 ~.¥ to notify you that Faurecia Automotive Seating, Inc. ("Faurecia") currently expects to temporarily close and idle its Auburn Hills, Michigan manufacturing facility, located at 2800 Superior Court, Auburn Hills, Ml 48326, commencing on August 22, 2009. It is currently anticipated that the idling of the Auburn Hills facility will occur during the 14.day period between August 22, 2009 and September 4, 2009. Some dismantling of equipment and machinery may occur after the idling of the Auburn Hills facility. Faurecia currently anticipates that this plant closing will be temporary and will result in temporary but indefinite layoffs of 20 non-union employees and 167 union-represented employees. Given the economic uncertainties facing the automotive industry generally and Faurecia and the Auburn Hills facility's primary customer, GM, in particular, the duration of the layoff cannot at this time be determined. II is possible that this layoff could extend beyond six months. It is also possible that the Auburn Hills facility may ultimately be permanenHy closed, in which case, these layoffs would become permanent. We have enclosed a list of the job classifications that will be affected by the temporary plant closing and the number of employees who will be affected in each of those job classifications. The affected employees do not have bumping rights to displace other employees from their jobs due to the layoffs associated with the temporary plant closing. The affected union-represented employees are represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW Local 5960.
