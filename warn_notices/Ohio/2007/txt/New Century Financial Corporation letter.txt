U FINANCIAL CORPORATION A NEW SHADE Of BLUE CHIP"' April2,2007 Jim Turner Chief, Rapid Response Section Ohio Department of Job and Family Services 145 South Front Street P.O. Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216-1618 Re: Notification Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C ¤¤ 2101 et seq.) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ¤ 4141.29(C) Dear Mr. Turner: Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. ¤¤ 2101 et seq., and Ohio Rev. Code Ann.¤ 4141.29(C), on April 2, 2007, New Century Financial Corporation (the "Company"), on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, New Century Mortgage Corporation and Home123 Corporation, will be conducting a plant closing of its facility at 4349 Easton Way, Columbus, OH 43219. The Company has recently experienced a number of unforeseeable business circumstances that have resulted in a sudden, dramatic, and unexpected liquidity crisis. A series of events .including a downturn in market conditions, diminished investment demands, and New Century's inability to release its annual audited financial statements for the 2006 fiscal year -have suddenly and negatively affected New Century's financial condition. In addition, the Company has received notices from all of its lenders asserting that the Company is in default under its financing arrangements. The Company's lenders' restrictions or refusals to allow the Company to access their financing arrangements have substantially limited the Company's capacity to fund new loans. As a result, the Company has been forced to cease accepting loan applications from prospective borrowers. During this entire period, New Century has been actively engaged in discussions with lenders and other third parties regarding a refinancing and other alternatives to obtain additional liquidity that would have allowed the Company to resume funding borrowers' loans and continue all of its current operations. Providing this notice previously would have been detrimental to those efforts. Unfortunately, the Company has been unable to obtain such replacement financing. -Page 1 of2 .A N E W SH AD E OF BL U E C H l P'" As indicated above, the plant closing is expected to begin today, April 2, 2007. While the last day of active employment for the affected employees will be on April 2, 2007, at which time these employees will be relieved of all job duties, they will continue to be paid through April 13, 2007. If the employee is currently enrolled in New Century's benefit plan, he or she will receive continued benefits coverage through April 30, 2007, followed by the opportunity for continued coverage under COBRA. The job titles of the positions to be affected, the number of affected employees in each job classification, and the schedule of separations are shown on Exhibit A, which is attached and made a part of this notice. The entire plant will be closed. This plant closing is expected to be permanent in nature. The affected employees are unrepresented. Bumping rights do not exist with respect to this action. Due to the reasons stated above, we have been unable to provide additional notice of this plant closing. In light of the nature of the Company's business going forward, we do not believe that the statutes cited above should apply to this situation. Nonetheless, we are giving as much notice as possible. For further information, please contact New Century's HR Service Center at (866) 598-8678. Vice President, Human Resources Enclosure SFI :667420.1 -Page2of2.A NEW SHADE OF BLUE CHIP'M EXHIBIT A Number  Occupation/ Job Title  Date of Separation  33  Account Executive  04/13/2007  4  Account Executive, WS  04/13/2007  12  Account Manager  04/13/2007  2  Account Manager, Jr  04/13/2007  3  Account Manager, Sr  04/13/2007  1  Appraisal Clerk  04/13/2007  1  Appraisal Manager, Region  04/13/2007  I  Area Sales Manager  04/13/2007  1  Closer  04/13/2007  1  Closing Manager  04/13/2007  4  Closing Specialist I  04/13/2007  1  Collateral Analyst  04/13/2007  1  Customer Service Mgr, WS  04/13/2007  1  Division Operations Mgr  04/13/2007  3  Document Processor  04/13/2007  3  Funder  04/13/2007  2  Funder Prime  04/13/2007  1  Funder, Sr  04/13/2007  1  Operations Manager, Region  04/13/2007  1  Opr Guide Advisor, WS  04/13/2007  1  Receptionist  04/13/2007  1  Region Manager  04/13/2007  1  Regional Underwriting Manager  04/13/2007  2  Released Loan Coordinator  04/13/2007  1  Risk Manager  04/13/2007  3  Set-Up Coordinator  04/13/2007  2  Shipper  04/13/2007  7  Underwriter  04/13/2007  1  Underwriter, Sr  04/13/2007  3  Underwriting Specialist II  04/13/2007  4  Underwriting Specialist III  04/13/2007  2  Unit Manager  04/13/2007  1  Wholesale Coordinator  04/13/2007  3  Wholesale Liaison II  04/13/2007  1  Wholesale Liaison III  04/13/2007  110  Total  Exhibit A
