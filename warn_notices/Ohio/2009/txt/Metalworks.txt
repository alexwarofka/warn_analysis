This closing of the entire facility will affect 28 hourly production employees and 2 working supervisors whose employment is being terminated effective today, January 13, 2009. As a supplier to the automotive industry, the company's business has been impacted. The company has been attempting to secure additional credit and to negotiate for additional capital to keep the business as a going concern. It believed that giving notice of the plant closing earlier would have prevented securing that new credit/capital. Unforiunatdy, those attempts have been unsuccessful, with the last prospective deal being rejected late last night. While we continue to seek credit from vendors and customers, jt is now in an attempt to wind dmvn the business in an orderly fashion. Because of these realities, we are now giving notice of this employment loss. The employees are not represented by a union and will have no bumping rights. Fur1her information may be obtained from Chris Jochum, Vice President Human Resources, Metalworks Worldwide Ltd, 3180 Berea Road, Cleveland, Ohio 4411 I, (216)889-2233. Very truly yours, {/£J;t,:~Yl.7!1l!V-' \/ Chris Jochum Metalworks Worldwide CLE ¥ 1102666.1 Elizabeth R.
