The facility currently employs a total of 97 workers and it is anticipated that all of them will be permanently laid-off at that time. A list of the affected positions and the number of affected employees in those positions is attached. (Exhibit A). Because the facility is closing, employees do not have bumping rights. Certain employees at the facility are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local #332 (the "Union").
