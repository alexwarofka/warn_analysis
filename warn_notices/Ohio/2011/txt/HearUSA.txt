Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216 Dear Ms. Worrell: This letter constitutes notice pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN Act") that HearUSA, Inc. (the "Company") anticipates that a mass layoff may occur at all of the locations listed on attached Exhibit A. The Company has sent notice to all of the affected employees that operations may cease between July 16, 2011 and July 30, 2011 if a new owner is unable to acquire the Company and continue business operations. Included in Exhibit A is a list of job titles of positions to be affected and the number of affected employees in each job classification. The Company's employees do not have bumping rights. There is no bargaining unit representation within the Company. The planned action would be permanent. If the action were to occur, it would be a mass layoff rather than a plant closing. A separate letter has notified the mayors of each municipality in each jurisdiction where the affected employees work. We are asking regional and local agencies to provide any available assistance to affected employees. It is with regret that this action is taken. Any help that the State of Ohio may be able to provide to the employees who are affected by the possible mass layoff would be greatly appreciated. For further information, please contact me at (561) 478-8770 at extension 134. Sincerely, Paige Brough Senior Vice President Communications Enclosure 3654360-l 1250 Northpoint Parkway I West Palm Beach, FL 33407 I PH: (561) 478-8770 !Fax: (561) 688-8877 I www.hearusa.com AKRON LOCATION  Patient Care Coordinator  Akron OH (29416) 3200 West Market St Suite 108 Akron, OH 44333  Patient Care Coordinator  1  Total Number of Employees  1  DUBLIN LOCATION  Area Manager  Regional Midwest (00220) Dublin OH (29412) 6000 Venture Drive Suite A Dublin, OH 43017  Audiologist  Dublin OH (29412) 6000 Venture Drive Suite A Dublin, OH 43017  Division Coordinator  Regional Midwest (00220) Dublin OH (29412) 6000 Venture Drive Suite A Dublin, OH 43017  Patient Care Coordinator  Dublin OH (29412) 6000 Venture Drive Suite A Dublin, OH 43017  Area Manager  1  Audiologist  1  Division Coordinator  1  Patient Care Coordinator  1  Total Number of Employees  4  GROVE CITY LOCATION  Audiologist  Grove City OH (29421) 4024 Parkmead Drive Grove City, OH 43123  Patient Care Coordinator  Grove City OH (29421) 4024 Parkmead Drive Grove City, OH 43123  Audiologist  1  Patient Care Coordinator  1  Total Number of Employees  2  EX ~IBIT I IV -r HEATH OH LOCATION  Audiologist  Heath OH (29441) 697 Hopewell Drive Heath, OH 43056  Patient Care Coordinator  Heath OH (29441) 697 Hopewell Drive Heath, OH 43056  Audiologist  1  Patient Care Coordinator  1  Total Number of Employees  2  WESTERN HILLS LOCATION  Audiologist  Western Hills OH (29401) 5520 Harrison Avenue Cincinnati, OH 45248  Audiologist  1  Total Number of Employees  1  TOTAL NUMBER OF OHIO EMPLOYEES= 10 2
