The company expects this layoff to be permanent. One Hundred three (103) associates are being )aid off due to this action. Bumping rights do not exist The decision to layoff at this facility was the result of an unforeseeable economic environment, including an unprecedented deterioration of market conditions with no foreseeab]e improvement and the failure of an effort to find a buyer who would have maintained operations. The company was unable to provide notice sooner because that would have prevented the company from seeking to sell to a business to continue its operations. Unfortunately) the company was unable to negotiate such a transaction. We regret having to take this action because of its impact on the employees and the local community. Should you have any questions, please contact Katrina Plourde, Zomax, at 614-766.3177 (katrina.plourde@zomax.com). Sincerely, Michael G.
