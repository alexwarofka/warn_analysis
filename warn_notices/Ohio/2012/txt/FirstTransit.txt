This closing may rise to the level necessary to trigger WARN Act notice. First Transit is providing this advance, written notice to, among other things, assist you in preparing for and adjusting to the upcoming transition. The layoffs resulting from this closing are expected to be permanent, and the entire facility is expected to be closed. As you may be aware, the Licking County Transit Board notified us on Thursday, November 29, 2012, that we were unsuccessful with our bid to retain their business. Because of this decision, First Transit, Inc. will terminate its service effective midnight, December 31, 2012. Layoffs will commence on January 1, 2012. Drivers will be laid off in accordance with the provisions of the labor agreement. The employment site(s) where the layoffs will occur is: First Transit, Inc. 
763 East Main Street 
Newark, Ohio 43055 
We expect the layoff process to be fully completed within 30 days of the effective date. All positions are affected by the layoff including: е Part-time drivers and Full-time drivers е Office Clerical A FirstGroup America Company www.firstgroupamerica.com 600 Vine Street Suite 1400 Cincinnati, OH 45202 Tel: 513 241 2200 Fax: 513 381 0149 е Full-time and Part-time dispatchers е Managers and supervisors As many as 61 (sixty-one) employees may be subjected to a layoff. However, it is probable that First Transit will have transfer opportunities available for many employees at other facilities. In the very near future, First Transit will provide a procedure for employees to express their interest in any of these transfer opportunities. This letter is intended to fulfill our obligation under the Worker Adjustment & Retraining Notification Act (WARN). It is our goal to place personnel at other First Transit, Inc. locations if possible. Please feel free to contact me or David Jones at (7 40) 334-5008 for further information. If you have any questions, please contact me at (513) 362-4512. Very truly yours, r'\. ~----.(,\.~AA \с~--~\__
