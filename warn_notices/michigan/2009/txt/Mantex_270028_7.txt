Box 30004 Lansing, Michigan 48909 Dear Ms. Canfora: The purpose of this letter is to inform your office that unforeseen business circumstances have forced Mantex Corporation ("Mantex") to permanently discontinue its faltering business operations and close its Imlay City, Michigan facility located at 611 Industrial Parkway, Imlay City, MI 48444. As of the date of this letter, approximately 60 employees remain at Mantex' s Imlay City, Michigan facility to continue the wind down of its business and financial affairs, and full closure of the facility will occur by March 24, 2009. All employees will be separated at that time. A precipitous loss of Mantex's customer base hasmade the closure of Mantex's Imlay City operation unavoidable. While Mantex has made every attempt to save the company through new business, new financing, or a sale, management has determined at this point that closure is inevitable. Should you have any questions, please contact Gary Yeomans at (810) 721-2100. Sincerf, f1 .rI/ I//'---,¥áffY~ /Mantex Corpoition Janagement '\/ RECEIVED MAR09 2009 RAPID RESPONSE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS {1687209:j
