Re: Bank of America -Layoffs at 4300 West Saginaw Hwy, Lansing. Ml Dear Mayor Bernero: Since merging in October 2007, Legacy LaSalle and Bank of America have focused on how best to combine two world-class organizations into one. This involves identifying overlap and finding efficiencies within our operations, while remaining focused on the impact to associates. After serious consideration, Bank of America has decided to consolidate the Deposit Contact Centers operations and discontinue performing this work at the Lansing, Ml office located at 4300 West Saginaw Hwy. This department will permanently close on or about October 31, 2008. As a result of this decision, approximately 179 associates will be separated when the department closes. Eligible associates are offered career transition resources as well as severance pay and benefits. No bumping rights exist. This notice is being provided pursuant to Illinois WARN and, to the extent applicable, the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act. Impacted associates at the 4300 West Saginaw Hwy facility have also received notice. If you have any questions regarding this Notice or need additional information, please contact me at 202.351.0111. cc: Deborah Hennessey Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Growth Bureau of Workforce Programs Workforce Transition Division, Rarid Response Section 201 North Washington Square, 51 Floor Governor Jennifer Granholm Office of the Governor Post Office Box 30013 Lansing, Ml 48909 Tel: 202.351.0112 á Fax: 202.785.1426 Banlc of America, DC9-920-07á01 1909 K Street, NW, 7th Floor, Suite 710, Wa.shington, DC 20006 Recycled Paper
