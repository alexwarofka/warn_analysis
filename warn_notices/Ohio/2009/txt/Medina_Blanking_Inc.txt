Based on current business conditions, we now foresee the temporary layoff lasting beyond six (6) months, therefore, we are providing this notice. Information regarding job titles/classification and the number of employees that have been affected is attached. The temporary layoffs and permanent reductions began on September 29, 2008 and have been adjusted through March 9, 2009 based on business conditions. The employees placed on temporary layoff retain recall rights for twelve (12) months from the effective date of layoff.
