Rb: ADVANCE NOTICE OF EMPLOYMENT LOSS Alpha Technology, Inc. (ALTEC) is providing advance notice of an employment Joss that may qualify as a plant closing and/or mass layoff for the purposes of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 USC 2101 et seq. (WARN). As of the date of this notice, ALTEC expects that the first employment losses at issue could occur as soon as January 15, 2011 and that the number of employment losses aggregated within the first six ( 6) months thereafter will be sufficient to meet the threshold requirements of Section 2( d) of WARN, 29 U.S.C. §2102(d). Thus, while ALTEC may be providing more than the statutorily required sixty ( 60) days' advance notice, it does so in good faith to meet the purposes of the WARN Act. NAME AND ADDRESS OF EMPLOYJ\1ENT SITE WHERE EMPLOYMENT LOSS WILL TAKE PLACE Alpha Technology Corporation 251 Mason Road Howell, MI 48844 RECEIVED IN NOV12 2010 RAP\DRESPONSE
