Box 1618 Columbus, Ohio 43216-1618 Dear Ms. Patton: Pursuant to the provisions of the "Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act" ("WARN") you are hereby notified of employment reductions due to mass layoffs, as defined by the WARN Act at the Concord Steel facility, located at 1451 Buena Vista N.E., Warren Ohio 44482. As a result of a recent significant and continuing decline in customer orders, Concord Steel has found it necessary to cut its production operation. A number of employees have been placed on short-term layoff since February 1, 2009. Because of these conditions, the temporary layoffs resulting from this economic downturn may continue for at least sixty (60) days, and may result in the lay-off of approximately 50 employees which may exceed six (6) months in duration. This unforeseeable business circumstance necessitated short notice of this event. The affected employees are represented by a labor organization, District 1 (United Steelworkers Union), located at 950 Youngstown Warren Road, Niles, Ohio 44446. Individuals who are laid off should be eligible to recover unemployment compensation benefits. The job titles of positions affected and the number of affected employees in each job classification are set forth in Attachment "A" hereto. Employees who are affected by layoffs described in this letter and who are within the group described in Attachment "A" have been given written notice under the WARN Act. This notice is supplied to you pursuant to the WARN Act as well and has been supplied to the appropriate bargaining representative of any represented employees. If you have any questions concerning anything contained in this letter, please contact Jim Jones at (330) 394-3675 Ext. 107. Very truly yours, J~
