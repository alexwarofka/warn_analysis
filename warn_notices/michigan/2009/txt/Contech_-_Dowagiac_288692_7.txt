Notice of Dowagiac MI Facility Shutdown Thisnotice is being provided to you on June 29, 2009 pursuant to the Worlcer Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, which requires employers to give official notice to certain government units or officials of a pending facility shutdovvn. As you may know, Contech has experienced extremely difficult financial challenges resultingin the Company's efforts to reorganize in bankruptcy. This eventually led to a sale to Cerion LLC. Although this sale has permitted us the opportunity to avoid liquidation, it does not address the economic conditio11$ in theautomotive industry thal will continue to place a strain on casb flow. As part of our efforts to ensure ongoing ope1ations moving forward, our entire :facility located at S124l M-51 North. Dowagiac, Michigan, will bepermanently closed on August 30, 2009. Therefore, all Contech positions and jobs at the facility will be eliminated on the same date. It is anticipated that 64 employees will be affe<;;ted by the closure of the Dowagiac facility. Attachedis a list of the affectedpositionsandthe number of employees holding each position. Affected employees were not represented by a union, and have no bumping rights. Contech took a number of steps to avoid the shutdown, in.eluding negotiating with the Customersto replace or retain business moving forward. Unfortunately our efforts were unsuccessful resulting in significant over capacity, low sales, and high cost issues. It is not without remorse that wemake this decision, as the Dowagiac facility has provided over 50 years of service to the automotive industry. Should you have any questions, please contact Ralph Turner, Director of Human Resources, at 269-384-1255. Ll!GAL_US_E# 83443404.! S6-29 G9 lG:44 CONTECH AUBURN HR CONFIDENTIAL ID= 219 925 8457 PS2/S3employee_i< last_name first_name location class_coae nr_staws 1un:::r 000222180 Abshagen Jack Dowagiac Plant H Employee (Full-Time) Maintenance Mechanic 000222189 Abshagen Ronald Dowagiac Plant H Employee (Full-Time) Die Cast Se:up 000222075 Bement Anna Dowagiac Plant H Employee (Full-Time) Misc Machine Operator 000222046 Blue Charles Dowagiac Plant H Employee (Full-Time) Machine Technician C 000222068 Brosnan Robert Dowagiac Plant E Employee (Full-Time) Toolroom Supervisor 000222197 Carlson David Dowagiac Plant H Employee (Full-Time) Machine Technician C 000222203 Carlton Bradley Dowagiac Plan!
