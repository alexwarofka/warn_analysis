This was a difficult decision because of the impact it has on employees, their families and the community.

Employees will be eligible for severance, extended benefits and outplacement assistance. If you wish to contact me directly, please call 419-536-6680. Sincerely, Jim Kingry Vice President Door Fabrication Division Attachment: WARN Termination Notification 03/13/2007 10:37 FAX 419 536 7460 DORFABTOLEDO 14!003 Masonite International Corporation March 13, 2007 Dear Masonite Toledo Team Member: RE: WARN Tenninatlon Notification This letter is a legally required notice in accordance with the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) of 1988, concerningthe dosureof the Toledo Door Fabrication facility, Toledo, Ohio owned by Masonite located at 830 North Westwood Avenue, Toledo, OH 43607.
