DEVELOPMENT Rapid Response Section Ohio Department of Job and Family Services Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) Act PO Box 1618 Columbus, Ohio 43216-1618 To Whom It May Concern:: As you know, it was with great sadness that we recently announced today that we will be closing our Cuyahoga Falls facility by the close of the third quarter of 2009. The Cuyahoga Falls facility is located at 129 Marc Avenue, Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio 44223. Market dynamics make it no longer feasible for us to continue to machine and polish wheels in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. As a result, Accuride's aluminum wheel production at Cuyahoga Falls will be consolidated into Accuride's other facilities ; resulting in the closure of the Cuyahoga Falls facility . It is anticipated that consolidation will be completed by the third quarter of 2009. In the interim, there will be a gradual decrease of production at the Cuyahoga Falls facility until all customer orders can be fulfilled through production at other Accuride facilities. The Company will begin moving equipment from the Cuyahoga Falls facility in mid-February 2009 and will move additional lines approximately every 2-3 weeks thereafter. A list of the job titles and number of employees in each position is attached for your reference. Layoffs will be conducted for the hourly work force in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement between Accuride and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) , Local Number 70, that is in effect at the plant and bumping rights will not apply. Mr. Dan Saunier, 700 Marguerite Ave., Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio 44221, is Unit Chairman of Local 70. Although our presence in Cuyahoga Falls has been short-lived , we appreciate your cooperation and support. And, going forward we would appreciate your continued service to the Cuyahoga Falls facility. If you have further questions or need additional information , you may contact Debbie Smith at (330) 916-8716. Sincerely , ;7}/ (~ / . . l~,,_,,( (T> __)_ Tom Butorac Director of Operations Accuride Corporation -Cuyahoga Falls Expected Hourly Reduction Schedule for Shutdown of Cuyahoga Falls
