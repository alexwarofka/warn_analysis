Dear Gov. Granholm; After a careful review of our operations, we have made the difficult decision to cease operations at our Pro*Pak plant at S45 E. 32nd Street in Holland at the end of this year. This facility is one of two plants we operate in Holland. It has been a part of our business since 1998 and employs approximately 90 people. It has been used chiefly for contract manufacturing for third-party beverage brands. As these brand owners have expanded their own manufacturing capabilities, their need for contract manufacturing has decreased significantly, leading to our decision to close Pro*Pak. Our other manufacturing facility in Holland, located nearby at 777 Brooks Ave., and our warehouse, located at 900 Brooks Ave., remain an Integral part of our operations going forward. These manufacturing and distribution centers continue to employ approximately 230 people. Statewide, we will continue to employ more than 700 at seven facilities after the end of this year. As we wind down operations at Pro¥Pak over the next three months, our people there are our primary focus, and we are making every effort to treat them with the respect and fairness they deserve for their many contributions to our business. We will provide employees with severance packages based on years of service, as well as career counseling and outplacement assistance. Where possible, we will place them in other positions within Dr Pepper Snapple Group's manufacturing operations depending on their qualifications and desire to relocate to nearby markets. In closing, we will keep you informed of our plans concerning our property. If you have any questions or need any further information, please do not hesitate to call me at (913) 469-0102. Sincerely, Randy Downing Vice President, Corporate Affairs
