Box 1618 Columbus, Ohio 43216-1618 Re: Notice Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act Dear Mr. Calhoun: This notice of a plant closing is being provided to you in compliance with the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification ("WARN") Act, which requires employers to give notice to certain government units and officials of a pending mass layoff or plant closing. This letter serves to advise you that Sypris Technologies ("Sypris" or "the Company") has made the decision to permanently close the Company's facility at 13267 State Route 68 South, Kenton, Ohio ("the Kenton Facility"). As part of the plant closing, the Company will terminate the jobs of all employees at the Kenton Facility. It is our intention to provide the employees, individually or through their labor organization representative, with 60 days' advance notice of their termination date. Although not anticipated at this time, we do recognize that a plant closing may occur in fewer than 60 days for some employees, due to circumstances beyond the Company's control or unforeseeable business circumstances. The closing of the Kenton Facility is expected to occur in several phases over a period of time, to be completed by approximately May 2, 2009. The first terminations are expected to occur in 2009, and you will be notified in a subsequent notice as to the first and subsequent termination phases. All jobs at the Facility, bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit alike (including management and supervision), will be eliminated, numbering 101 active bargaining unit employees, 109 inactive bargaining unit employees, and 22 active and inactive non-bargaining unit employees. A list of the currently affected positions is attached as Schedule A. Information on subsequent affected positions will be provided in the future as we develop it. Affected bargaining unit employees are represented by the United Steelworkers Union, Local 1.109, which has also been notified. No "bumping" rights exist for any employees at the Kenton Facility. SYPRIS TECHNOLOGIES INC. 101 BULLITT LANE, SUITE 205, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY 40222 ¥ (502) 420-1222 FAX (502) 420-1232 www.sypris.com We appreciate the support you and the State of Ohio have given the workforce and management over the years, and we will do our best to ease the transition for those impacted. Sincerely, Mark Cain Vice President, Human Resources Schedule A Number in Job Title oosition 6 Final Bench Operator 4 All All All All Handweld Layout 15 All Handweld Ring 1 All Heid Group All8 Industrial Electrician All5 Industrial Mechanic 9 All lntreoal Axle Group 11 All Machine Assistant 9 All Mill & Thread 6 All OPC Coordinator 1 All Quality Technician 2 All Robotic Weld RPR Lathe D All Seneca Falls Lathe SNSTR Mill & CN All ST Press All ST Press & Rina 1 All ST Press Group 1 All Stock Mover All6 Tool & Cutter 2 All Trio Group A Trio Group B Weld Assist Sup Plant Manaoer 1 All 7 All 1 All All All AllAll1 Payroll Clerk 1 All HR Rep 1 All Buyer 1 All QA Enoineer 1 All Laidoff Employees 72 All
