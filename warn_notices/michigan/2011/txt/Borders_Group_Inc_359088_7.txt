Borders Group, Inc. 100 Phoenix Dr. BORDERS© Ann Arbor, MI 48108 T(734} 477-1100 CONFIDENTIAL July 19, 2011 RECEIVEDIN VIA FAX AND FEDEX Margaret Sayles JUL26 2011 Acting Manager -Rapid Response Workforce Development Agency RAPIDRESPONSE Victor Office Center 201 N. Washington Sq., 3rd Floor Lansing, Michigan 48913 Fax (517) 373-4648 Dear Ms. Sayles: We are writing to notify you that Borders Group, Inc. (the "Company") will be permanently laying off all of its employees (presently 477) at its facility located at 100 Phoenix Dr., Ann Arbor, Michigan 48108 (the "Michigan facility"), beginning on or about July 29, 2011, and concluding on or about December 31, 2011. These layoffs are the unexpected and unforeseen result of a forced liquidation of the Company due to the inability to find an accredited purchaser and/or obtain a sufficient capital infusion. Employees will be separately notified as to the effective date of his or her separation of employment from the Company. Any and all layoffs will be in connection with a permanent closing of the Michigan facility and will affect all job classifications (a list of each job classification and the number of affected employees in each such job classification is attached). No employees will be offered comparable jobs at any nearby Company facility. In addition, no bumping rights exist, there are no union representatives to be notified, and there are no rights to transfer. Please be advised that, prior to this date, the Company had been actively seeking capital and/or a purchaser in order to avoid or postpone any mass layoff or plant closing. In this regard, the Company reasonably and in good faith believed that the provision of additional notice may have precluded it from obtaining necessary capital and/or finding an accredited purchaser of the business. However, the sale did not close and, consequently, a liquidation of the Company is required. These circumstances were not foreseeable by the Company until just recently, and the Company is providing as much notice as reasonably possible under the circumstances in accordance with any obligations it may have under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification ("WARN") Act, 29 U.S.C. ¤ 2101 et seq. Under no circumstance shall the Company's submission of this information constitute or be deemed an admission of any obligation under the federal WARN Act. Please contact Rosalind Thompson, SVP of Human Resources at (734) 477-1384, with any questions. Sincerely, Rosalind Thompson SVP, Human Resources LIST OF AFFECTED EMPLOYEES Job Title A/P Manager Count A/P Representative I Count A/P Representative Ill Count A/P Representative IV Count A/P Supervisor Count Accountant I Count AD-Accounting &Control Count AD-DC QA & lnventorv Control Count AD-Store Financial Planning Count AD-Treasury Count Advanced Support Technician Count Airport Operations Manager Count Analyst I Count Analyst II Count Analyst Ill Count Analyst-SEO and Web Count Aoolication Support Analyst Count Applications Architect Count Associate Buyer Count Associate Purchasing Agent Count Bank, Payroll & Sales Rec M~tr Count Benefits Clerk Count Benefits Manager Count Benefits Representative Count Bibliographic Svcs &COS Mgr Count Business Systems Analyst -Sr Count Business Systems Analyst Count Buyer Assistant Count Buyer Count Cafe Services Manager Count Campaign Analyst II Count Category Marketing Specialist Count Claims Specialist Count Computer Operations Supervisor Count Computer Operator -Sr Count Computer Operator Count Construction Analyst JICount Content Developer-Digital Count Copy Editor Count Corporate Affairs Manager Count Corporate HR Manager Count Creative Manager Count Customer Service Rep Count Data Security Specialist Count Database Administrator Count DC Human Resources Manager Count Department Assistant Count Desktop Support Administrator Count Director -Marketing Count Number of
