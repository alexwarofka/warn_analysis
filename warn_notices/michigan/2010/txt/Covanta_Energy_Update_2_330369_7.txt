Michigan Waste Energy, Inc. (" Michigan Waste"), previously gave notice that it anticipated permanently laying off all of its approximately 150 employees at its Detroit facility beginning on August 31, 2010. Because of changing circumstances, the contemplated layoffs will not be effectuated on August 31, 2010, and operations at the Michigan Waste Detroit facility will continue for at least the next 60 days. During that period of time, Thermal Ventures II, LP ("Thermal"), will continue to determine whether it will acquire ownership of Michigan Waste and continue its operations at the Michigan Waste Detroit facility. However, should Thermal decide not to purchase Michigan Waste, Michigan Waste anticipates that it will cease operations at the facility and permanently layoff all Michigan Waste employees beginning on September 30, 2010. The employment of each individual laid off on or after September 30, 2010, will be terminated as of the effective date of the lay off. The job titles for the positions to be affected and the number of employees currently in each affected job classification are identified on the attached list. Local 324 of the International Union of Operating Engineers represents many of the employees to be permanently laid off. The name and address of its chief elected officer is: Mr. John Hamilton
