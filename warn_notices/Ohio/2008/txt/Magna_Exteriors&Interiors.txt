Dear Representatives: Regrettably, due to our current business circumstances, T.E.A.M. Systems has found it necessary to lay off employees from their positions at the Company's facility located at 1800 Nathan St., Toledo, OH 43604. Exact dates of the layoffs have not been determined, but they will begin no earlier than January 5, 2009 and no later than January 18, 2009. The approximate number of affected employees is believed to be around 140. While we hope that a significant number of employees will eventually be recalled, based on the uncertain conditions facing the industry and our customer, these layoffs should be considered permanent at the present time. To the extent that these laycffs constitute a '"mass layoff' or "plant closing", as those terms are defined under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), this letter is intended to fulfill the Act's requirements. By providing this letter, however, T.E.A.M. Systems does not concede that the Act applies or that notices are otherwise required. If you would like further information, please contact me at (419) 324-3394. Sincerely,. t.../i,1 ¥. ; -/ U11~7)-/~
