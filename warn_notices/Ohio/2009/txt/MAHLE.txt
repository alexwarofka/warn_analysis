Mahle Engine Components is closing its facility located at 17226 Industrial Highway, Caldwell, Ohio. The closing of the facility was first announced on January 4, 2008. The exact date of the closing is uncertain, but the facility is projected to close on or around June 30, 2009. The closing is expected to be permanent. All of the jobs in the facility will be affected. In all, it's expected that 190 people will be separated from their jobs. Job separations will occur until the plant is closed. An attachment shows the affected positions and the number of people in each position represented by the United Steelworkers Local 4836. The chief elected officer of the USW Local 4836 is President Jason Rich, and his on-site address is 17226 Industrial Highway, Caldwell, Ohio 43724. The decision to close the facilities was a difficult one but was based on the corporation's decision to exit certain operations in North America, as well as on the global marketplace. Meetings were held with people in the facility to discuss their benefits and other assistance that may be available to them. If you have any questions about this notice, please contact me, Kirn Stewart, Human Resources Manager, at 17226 Industrial Highway, Caldwell, OH 43724, phone number (740) 732-3272. Sincerely, k~~~ Kirn Stewart Human Resources Manager Mahle Engine Components xc: file (w/ attachment
