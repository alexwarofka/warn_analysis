Box 1618 Columbus, Ohio 43216-1618 RE: Notice of Job Reduction To Whom it May Concern: The purpose of my letter is to provide notice by Dover Chemical Corporation of the reduction of forty-eight (48) positions with the permanent layoff of 48 employees at 3676 Davis Road NW, Dover, Ohio 44622. Although this reduction does not meet the WARN Act minimum for requiring notice, WARN encourages voluntary notice even when it does not apply. The Union representing the Company's production and maintenance employees has been on strike since February 1. During this time, the Company has operated using significantly fewer employees, resulting in a reduction in the bargaining unit due to this strike. The sudden national economic downturn and our unexpected ability to meet our needs with many fewer employees were unforeseen. During the strike and going forward from today, March 18, 2009, the Company has reduced its employment because of the strike. Even after the strike ends, the bargaining unit will remain smaller by 45 positions. The bargaining unit, including all impacted employees, is represented by Teamsters Local 92. The President of the Local is Bob Jackson and its address is 1127 9th Street SW, Canton OH 44707 . The plant steward is Cary McCarty. Impacted employees will be determined by collectively bargaining guidelines on job loss, including seniority , layoff and bumping. CLE-1131352. 1 In addition to the 45 bargaining unit jobs, three salaried positions are permanently reduced. One individual has accepted a severance package. There are no bumping rights. Further information may be obtained from Dorothy Hartong, HR Manager, Dover Chemical Corporation, 3676 Davis Road NW, Dover, Ohio 44622, (330) 365-3641. Very truly yours, ~--.Vice President of Operations Dover Chemical Corporation CLE -1131352.1
