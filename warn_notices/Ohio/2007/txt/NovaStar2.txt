This action is being taken due to an economic downturn in our business. This layoff is expected to be long-term or permanent. Your state is impacted by this reduction in force. Employees will be released from employment at the following Ohio facilities: 4059 Kincross Parkway Suite 200 Richfield, OH 44286 Summit County, Ohio 6150 Oak Tree Blvd. Suite 300 Independence, OH 44131 Cuyahoga County, Ohio The facility in Richfield, Ohio will be a plant closing. The Independence, Ohio facility will experience a mass layoff. Please note that the impacted employees will be paid for 60 additional days of employment, as if they were still working for the Company. Their employee benefits packages also will continue during this 60.day period. The 60-day period starts on March 17, 2007 and ends on May15, 2007 Effective immediately, the employees are released from any requirement to report to their work sites. Hopefully, this notice, the 60-day payment, and their time off will assist them in finding alternate employment. There is no union involved in this situation. There is no provision in the Company's policies for transfer, bumping, or reassignment. The Human Resources Department, Amy Freedman (216) 525-5913, is prepared to answer questions and assist in any way it can to help ease our employees through this transition. Sincerely, ~~ Annette Regan
