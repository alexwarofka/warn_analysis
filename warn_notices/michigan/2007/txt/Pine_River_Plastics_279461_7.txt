Washington Square Lansing, MI 48913 This notice is being given to you pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, which requires employers to give official notice to certain government units or officials of a pending facility shutdown. As you may be aware, on March 2, 2007, Pine River Plastics, Inc. learned that the group proposing to purchase Pine River's assets would not proceed with the transaction. Because of the decision by the purchaser not to proceed, and the related decision by Pine River's principal customers to resource their business to other suppliers, it is unlikely that Pine River will be able to continue its operations on a long term basis . Pine River had previously filed a voluntary petition for business reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in Detroit, Michigan on February 1, 2007. As a result of this recent development, Pine River expects that its plant located at 11 I I Fred W. Moore Hwy., St. Clair, MI 48079 will be permanently closed . While an exact date has not been established for this closUre, it is anticipated to take place in the next i 4 days, or possibly longer, depending on a number of factors, including the amount of time required for customers to resource their business . Lay-offs will begin immediately and will continue over this period as Pine River's workforce requirements decline . All positions and jobs at the plant will be eliminated . It is anticipated that I 95 employees at the plant will be affected by the closure of the plant. The facility is non-union. RECEIVEDPlease contact Human Resources if you have any questions. f1A~09 /'007 DETOl\549534 .1 IDITSV RAP fD /..;i :~:;;:r ~сс,i::OL: WORKFORC E PF!OGRAi\/i~ 1111 F.W.
