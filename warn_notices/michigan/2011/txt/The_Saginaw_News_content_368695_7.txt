Dear Stephanie Beckhorn, We're contacting you today to inform you about the launch of two new companies that will house all our operations from this point forward in Michigan and to deliver information as required by federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"). One new company, the MLive Media Group, will encompass all content, sales, and marketing operations for all our digital and print properties in Michigan. Another new company, Advance Central Services -also based in Michigan -will be a shared services company, the engine providing all production, distribution, purchasing, accounting, human resources, and other critical support functions for the MLive Media Group. These two companies -along with Advance Digital, who will continue to serve as the innovation engine behind the growth and development of an array of our products and services -will work hand-in-hand to deliver on the promise of our business in Michigan: to serve communities around the state with the highest quality news and information of the moment. We will collaborate with the communities we serve, the employees who work with us, the advertisers we partner with, and the users and readers who count on the news and information we provide. ...............

However,  that  will not  be the  case  for every employee,  so  layoff notices  are  being  sent  to  those  not  initially  selected.  Throughout  this  process  we'll treat  all our employe es  with  the professionalism  and  respect  they  deserve.  We are providing this notice to satisfy the requirements of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"). Thus, The Saginaw News, located at 203 S. Washington, Saginaw, will be terminating 12 employees on January 2, 2012. No employees are represented by unions and no employees have bumping rights. Listed below are the job titles and number of employees in each title whose employment will be terminated. Em pis  in Each  Job Title  Title  Administrator II  1  Cashier  2  Production Worker  2  Reporter I  4  Reporter II  2  Topic Editor-Sports ~  1  If you would like further information, please contact me at (616) 222.5818. Very truly yours, Dan Gaydou
