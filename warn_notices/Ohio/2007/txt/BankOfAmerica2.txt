Bank of America: Akron Telesales Dear Mayor Plusquellic: Since merging in January 2006, Legacy MBNA and Bank of America have focused on how best to combine two world-class organizations into one. This involves identifying overlap and finding efficiencies within our operations, while being mindful of the impact on associates. After serious consideration, Bank of America has decided to relocate the Akron Telesales unit to Beachwood and to permanently close the Bank of America facility located at 388 South Main Street in Akron. This decision is based on business consideration and is no way a reflection on the performance of ttJe associates or managers who work here, which has been outstanding. We currently anticipate that the Akron site will close on August 24, 2007. The Akron Telesales unit will relocate to Beachwood and open for business there on August 27, 2007. Associates will be offered a job at the new location. This notice is being provided pursuant to the Federal Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act of 1988 and applicable state law, if any. If you have any questions regarding this Notice or need additional information, please contact me at 202-351-0111. SinW~' ohn Collingwo~
