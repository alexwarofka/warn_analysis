Re: 	Notification of Facility Closing Pursuant to WorkerAdjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN'') Dear Rapid Response Director : As you may be aware, The Stanley Works has decided to close its Sabina 
production plant. The Company made this decision in an attempt to strategically 
consolidate our worldwide operations into fewer facilities. As a result, we anticipate 
permanently closing our facility at 197 Jefferson St, Sabina, OH 45169. 
It is anticipated that the closure will take place in several phases, with the first phase to take place between March 8, 2010, and March 21, 2010. At the end of the process, all positions and jobs at the facility will be permanently eliminated, although it is possible that some employees will be offered transfers to another area. With regard to the initial phase, we anticipate that approximately 56 employees will be affected by this action. Enclosed is a listing of the job titles, the positions to be affected, and the names of the workers currently holding the affected jobs. Bumping rights do exist at this facility, and those employees who maybe bumped are denoted on the spreadsheet as "bumped?" This notice is being given to you on January 6, 2010, pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988. This Act requires employers to give official notice to affected unions of a pending facility shutdown. Should you have any questions, please contact the me at 972-481-7383. JAN-06-10 16:29 From:SABINA FACILITYFORGE 9375845124 T-026 P 03/03 Job-969 l Senorlty Date I -.--' .--. -. .,с. 0-J LJ; ---с .. --~-1-~ ,,с--~ сс.0..
