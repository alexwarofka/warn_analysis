Based upon the information available now , these layoffs are expected to be permanent and the entire plant will be closed. No bumping rights exist. Although we deeply regret having to take this action, it has become necessary given our inability to receive financing, a circumstance which our bank recently and unexpectedly notified us. In fact, we received notice from our working capital lender, Hm1tington National Bank , on Friday , July 10, 2009 that it was declaring a default, demanding payment in full by July 17, 2009 , and would not consent to allow us to continue to use cash to operate. We are providing you·with this notice in compliance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2102 et seq. By providing you this notice , we hope to soften the blow of what will undoubtedly be a difficult time for B&C Machine and its employees. In the hopes that he can aid our employees in reducing the social and economic hardship created by these layoffs, a copy of this letter also is being sent to Mayor Robert J. Genet. Please feel free to contact me at 330-745-4013 to discuss any issue raised in this letter. Very truly yours, Rob Winebrenner Human Resources cc: Mayor Robert J. Genet
