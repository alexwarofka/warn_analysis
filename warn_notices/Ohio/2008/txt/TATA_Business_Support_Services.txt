Dear Mr. Turner: This letter constitutes notice under the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act 
("WARN"), 29 U.S.C. ¤2102 et seq., and related Department of Labor Regulations, that there will be a 
reduction in force at TATA Business Support Services Limited, 27845 State Route 7, North Tower 
Suite 200, Reno, Ohio 45750. We are hopeful that this reduction in force will be temporary as it is our 
desire to re-employ as many affected employees as possible. The reductions will commence during 
the period between 25 August 2008 and end on 5 September 2008. 
None of the affected employees have "bumping rights" and the affected employees are not 
represented by any labor organization or other union representative . 
A list of positions affected and the number of employees in each position is attached for your review. 
Should you require additional information, please feel free to contact Deborah Taylor at 850-981.4724 .
