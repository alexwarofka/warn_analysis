Dear Ms. Hennessey : In a letter to you dated June 25, 2007, we notified you in accordance with 20 C.F.R. section 639 that Spirit Airlines, Inc. is pennanently closing our entire reservation agent facility (the Spirit Airlines Reservation Center in Clinton Township, Michigan) located at 35088 Automation Drive, Clinton Township, Michigan 48035 on August 31, 2007. Further, in a letter dated August 27, 2007, we provided you with copies of extension notices which were provided to eight reservation agents who had agreed to work for Spirit longer than the August 31, 2007 closure date to assist with matters necessary for the finalization of the facility closure and transition. Since that date, only two reservation agents agreed to stay beyond the August 31, 2007 closure date -David Flores and Marcia Wilson. They have agreed to stay with the Company until September 23, 2007. Further, two individuals in the position of "Consultant, GDS" (they are the only individuals in this position in the Company) will not be laid off due to their specialized skills but wilt instead be remaining in their position and working from home. Additionally, as previously noted in my letter to you dated August 27, 2007, one employee will be transferring to a position in Ft. Lauderdale. Lastly, there were five lnfonnation Technology personnel who were also located at the Clinton Township facility who were not subject to the RIF (as they are not reservation agents} and they will be continuing in their positions and either working from home or possibly transferring to Ft. Lauderdale. Should you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact me at (954) 628-4865. Sincerely, SPIRIT AIRLINES. INC. RECEIVEDIOVau..l Derek Van Keuren.
