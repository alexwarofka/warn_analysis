Mark Birnbrich  Acting Rapid Response Administrator  Bureau of WIA  Ohio Department of Job & Family Services  4020 East Fifth A venue  Columbus, OH 43219  RE: WARN Act Notice Dear Mr . Birnbrich : This notice is being provided to you pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN'') , as well as the mass layoff notification requirements of the Ohio Unemployment Compensation laws as set forth in RC. д 4141.28(C) . Although it is doubtful that Production Paint Finishers , Inc. ("Production Paint") is subject to the WARN Act, given that it has less than 100 full time employees as such employees are defined in the Act, we have elected to provide you with notice of an anticipated mass layoff at our facility located at 140 Center Street in Bradford, Ohio. On Friday, March 12, 2010, we received written notification from our largest customer that its orders will cease near the end of April 2010 . Due to this sudden, unforeseen business circumstance , we will be forced to layoff approximately 66 employees . Attached you will find a list of the job classifications affected , as well as the total number of employees that will be affected in each such classification . On Wednesday, March 17, 2010, I will conduct a meeting with all Production Paint employees to advise them of the anticipated mass layoff We will also provide written notification to those employees who will be affected by the mass layoff by placing a letter in an envelope along with their paycheck on Thursday March 18, 2010. The anticipated start date for the layoffs is April 12, 2010 . Layoffs are expected to continue through April 26, 20 l 0, depending on our business needs to fulfill the final orders of our largest customer . Although we are actively soliciting new customers and remain hopeful that some of the laid off employees will be recalled in the relatively near future , some of the layoffs will likely be permanent. е PRODUCTION INC.PAINT FINISHERS, PO BOX 127, 140 CENTER ST.
