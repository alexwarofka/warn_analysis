Re: Notice of Facility Closing per Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act 
To Designated State and Local Officials: 
In accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, 29 U.S.C. 2101, et seq., we are writing to inform you that The Men's Wearhouse, Inc.'s Bay City Distribution Center (DC) facility located at 311 3rd Street, Bay City, Michigan 48708 is expected to be permanently closed November 12, 2010. A handful of employees will be offered alternative positions and will not be laid-off if they accept those positions. All remaining positions and jobs at the Bay City facility will be eliminated on or about November 12, 2010, and up to 80 total regular employees will be affected with an employment loss. All Bay City DC employees impacted have received more than 60 days advance written notice of the relocation and/or position elimination and facility closure. It is expected that most, if not all, of the affected employees will be offered severance pay based on years of service, employment classification and compensation. None of the affected employees have bumping rights. None of the employees are represented by a union. We anticipate that one or more employees will remain employed for a limited time (no more than 60 days) after the facility is closed to assist with administrative tasks related to the closing of the facility. Infonnation regarding the job titles of the positions to be affected, the number of affected employees in each job classification, is provided below; each of these employees received WARN notices on or about September 8, 2010: RECEIVED IN SEP 13 2010 RAPIDRESPONSE 40650 Encyclopedia Circle¥ Fremont California 94538-2453 ¥ Phone: (510) 657-9821 Page 2 of2 Admin -Human Resources  1  Driver -Full Time  4  Driver -Part Time  1  FT Dry Cleaning Staff  10  FT Laundry Staff  5  General Manager  1  Manager  1  Mechanic  1  Operations Manager  1  Quality Control Specialist -DC  I  Staff -Non Office Full Time  1  Supervisor  2  Tailor-FT  1  Transportation Ops Manager  1  Tuxedo Lead  5  Tuxedo Staff -Full Time  44  Grand Total  80  There are also approximately 45 seasonal employees not protected by WARN who were hired in late Spring 2010 with full understanding and agreement that their employment was seasonal and temporary in nature and would end following the end of the peak prom and wedding season in late Summer or very early Fall.
