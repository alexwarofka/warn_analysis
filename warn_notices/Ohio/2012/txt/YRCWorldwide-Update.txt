Box 1618 Columbus, Ohio 43216 Re: Notice of Job Losses Dear Ms. Maybriar: Please accept this notice that YRC Worldwide Inc. (the "Company") permanently closed its facility located at 1077 Gorge Boulevard, Akron, Ohio 44310 ("Gorge Blvd.") on March 31, 2012. In conjunction with this closure, the Company transferred 120 employees from Gorge Blvd. to 557 E. Tallmadge Ave., Akron, Ohio 44310, to assist in the wind down of the operations formerly l~cated at Gorge Blvd. The completion of that wind down ultimately will result in additional permanent job losses at 557 E. Tallmadge Ave., Akron, OH 44310. Five (5) additional job losses will occur at the Tallmadge Ave. location on September 28 and September 29, 2012. (The first separations in the permanent facility closure occurred on March 30, 2012, as previously indicated.) The individual's job titles (including a notation as to the date of elimination) are attached. The affected employees are not represented by a union and do not have "bumping" rights. The employment losses are permanent. Should you need additional information or have any questions concerning this matter, please contact me at (913) 344-3694. Sincerely, Rocky Wilson Job Title  Number of Affected Employees  Scheduled Date of Reduction  Accountant 11  1  9/28/2012  Finance Specialist II  3  9/28/2012  Cargo Claims Specialist II  1  9/28/2012
