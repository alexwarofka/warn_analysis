RE: Extension of WARN Notice Dear Mr. Uram: Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN "), Lear Corporation ("Lear") is extending the notice contained in its March 9, 2007 letter regarding its intent to cease production and close its facility located at 4600 Nancy Avenue, and 17333 Healy, Detroit, Michigan 48212 (collectively "Detroit Plant"). Lear anticipates that the first employee separations will now commence on June 11, 2007 ( or a 14-day window period starting with such date). Lear continues to anticipate that the remaining separations and the permanent closure of the Detroit Plant will occur on September 30, 2007. The reason for the extension is unexpected delays in removing tools and equipment from the Detroit Plant. By copy of this letter, the following have also been given notice of the extension: John Dembowski, Chairperson, Lear Detroit Plant UAW, 4600 Nancy Avenue, Detroit, MI 48212 Douglas Grima , President , UAW, Westside Local 174, 29841 Van Born Road, Romulus, MI 48174 Rory Gamble, Director, Region IA, 9650 S.
