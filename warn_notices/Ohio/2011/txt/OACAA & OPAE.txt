RE: Notice of Industry-wide Mass Layoff The Ohio Association of Community Action Agencies and the Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy, representing fifty-five Home Weatherization Assistance Program (HW AP) employers, carefully analyzed the reduction in force situation within the network and its available options. It is with regret that we must report to you that the employers have to substantially reduce their Home Weatherization Assistance Program operations. As a result, we anticipate that we will permanently lay off approximately 700 employees over the next six months. Please see the attached for the affected employers and positions, wages of positions, and union representation information within two emp loyers. It is the networks intention to partner with the National Employment Law Project, the United Labor Agency, and its members to offer transition programs throughout regions in Ohio (including transition centers, dislocated worker services, and job placement services) to affected employees. It is our hope that these programs will lessen the impact of the mass layoff on individual employees, their families and on the communities as a whole. ~f& b~c~Cole, Executive Director Dave Rinebolt, Executive Dir ctor and Counsel
