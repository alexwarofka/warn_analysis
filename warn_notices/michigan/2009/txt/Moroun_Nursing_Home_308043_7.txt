Ottawa Street-4'h Floor Lansing, MI 48909 Dear Ms. Canfora: I am writing to infonn you that we believe the assets of the Home will soon be 
sold to another company. I am also pleased to report that this purchaser has indicated 
that they plan to offer employment to our employees and would continue to offer our 
residents a home in which they will receive quality care in an updated facility. However, 
if that planned sale does not go through as we anticipate, Moroun Nursing Home, Inc., 
will be closing its facility located at 8045 E. Jefferson Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48214, 
on December I, 2009. In this regard, I want to emphasize that we believe the Facility 
will remain open without any interruption in its operations. However, if for some reason 
the desired sale does not go through, this closure is expected to be permanent. 
Attached is a list of the affected positions and the names of employees currently 
holding those positions and expected to be affected. The expected date of separation is 
December 1, 2009. 
It is anticipated that approximately 135 employees will be affected by the action. 
Those employees do not have bumping rights that would apply in the case of the 
facility's closure. 
For further information regarding this matter, feel free to contact Grant T. Pecor 
at (616) 977-0077.
