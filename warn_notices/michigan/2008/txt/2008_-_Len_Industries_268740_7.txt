Box 30004 WORKFORCEPROGRAMSLansing, Michigan 48909 Dear Ms. Canfora: This notice is being provided to you pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988("WARN") which requires employers to give official notice of a pending mass layoff and/or plant closing. Len would like to provide as much notice as possible to its employees, representatives of its employees and affected governmental units of the forthcoming layoffs. Several of Len's major customers have experienced reduced sales and a decline in market share. Len Industries has been unable to obtain enough new business to replace the loss of existing business. Accordingly, it is with regret that I must advise you that the company has decided to substantially reduce operations. As a result, we anticipate that the company will permanently lay off approximately 50 employees as of June 2, 2008 over the next few months. The actual schedule of layoffs after the initial layoffs has not been finalized at this time. Accordingly, notification is given as follows: 1. 	Len Industries, Inc., 815 Rice Street, Leslie, Michigan 49251 will be laying off approximately 50 employees with the first layoffs scheduled to begin on or after June 2, 2008. 2. 	There are a total of approximately 155 regular full time employees in the company at the Leslie facility. 3. 	This action is because of overcapacity and reduced sales to major customers. 815 RICE STREET • LESLIE, Ml 49251·9466 PHONE(517)589-8241• FAX(517j589-B321 www.len-ind.com Ms. Chong-Anna Canfora Page2 September 15, 2008 4. 	The local contact person is Cindy Wells, Human Resource Manager, telephone# (517) 589-8241.
