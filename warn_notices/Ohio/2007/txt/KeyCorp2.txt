Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216-1618 RE: Amendment to previous WARN Letter to Rapid Response Section Ohio Department Of Job And Family Services Dated November 6, 2007 Dear Mr. Turner: This letter will amend our letter of November 6, 2007 to provide you with current information regarding KeyCorp's strategic actions to improve its productivity and operating efficiency. Please note that there is no change from our November 6 letter concerning the site located at 34 North Main Street, Dayton, Ohio 45402 . The purpose of this amended letter is to add the additional employment sites listed below and to revise the total number of employees at all sites that may experience an employment loss. Regrettably, this action will necessitate the loss of jobs at several "WARN" sites in the State of Ohio. Accordingly, KeyCorp, which includes its affiliated subsidiaries for purposes hereof, may experience a "plant closing" or "mass layoff' as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. ¤ 2101 et seq. (the "Act"), at the following employment sites in the State of Ohio: 2025 Ontario A venue 800 Superior A venue 127 Public Square Cleveland, OH 44115 Cleveland, OH 44115 Cleveland, OH 44114 4900 Tiedeman Rd 4910 Tiedeman Rd 34 North Main Street Brooklyn, OH 44144 Brooklyn , OH 44144 Dayton, Ohio 45402 KeyCorp anticipates that a total of 415 employees during 2008 may experience an "employment loss" at the above sites, which will begin at the Dayton location on January 1, 2008 (the first group of employees received individual notice letters at least 60 days prior to that date). Please note that the actual number of affected employees is expected to be Jess due to normal employee attrition and our internal reassignment program. Mr. Jim Turner December 3, 2007 Page 2 KeyCorp has long maintained a tradition of concern for employees and every effort is being made to assist employees where appropriate positions are unavailable through our internal reassignment program. Additionally, KeyCorp is offering outplacement programs to assist individuals in their career search and with specific skills such as resume writing and interview preparation. Employees whose positions are being eliminated are being provided separation pay and other benefits for which they qualify. KeyCorp remains deeply committed to all of our employees and communities, and we would be pleased to answer any questions you may have concerning this matter. Kindly direct your inquiries to Katie Ladd, Human Resources, (216) 689-0812. Please acknowledge your receipt of this letter by signing and returning the enclosed copy in the envelope provided for your convenience. Sincerely, KEY CORP Received this _ day of December, 2007 CHIEF, RAPID RESPONSE SECTION OHIO DEPARTMENT OF JOB AND FAMILY SERVICES Authorized Signer
