OSU recently extended these contracts through July 31, 2012. Until only recently, VGS, Inc. believed that the contracts would, in fact, be renewed. The expected renewal would have meant that VGS, Inc. would continue to provide services to OSU and that there would be no job eliminations. VGS, Inc. has attempted to avoid any unnecessary disruption to its workforce throughout this process. Based upon a meeting with OSU on July 5, 2012, however, VOS, Inc. is no longer certain that the contracts will be renewed. Despite this unforeseen and unexpected development, VGS, Inc.'s pursuit of renewed contracts with OSU is on-going. VGS, Inc. will keep you updated as to its progress in obtaining renewal of the contracts. In the event of non-renewal, VOS, Inc. wmpermanently cease providing services at the locations listed above as soon as July 31, 2012, or within fourteen (14) days thereafter. AB a result, the employment of all 143 VGS, Inc. employees working at OSU would be permanently terminated as soon as July 31, 2012, or within fourteen (14) days thereafter. Should you have any other questions, please contact Susie Barragate at (216) 881-6297. Sincerely, VOS, Inc. 13860098:f
