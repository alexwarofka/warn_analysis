This layoff, which will impact a few employees in the states listed below, is necessitated by the recent unexpected cancellation by a major customer ofa sizable Lipari/I&K supply contract. The attached Exhibit A reflects the job titles, and number of employees in each job title, who are expected to be terminated as a result of this job action. Layoffs, which will be permanent, are presently expected to begin on July 15, 2012, and may continue during the following 14-day period. However, this same customer also has just advised Lipari, contrary to its earlier indications, that it will withdraw a segment of its business as early as June 5, 2012. This development is expected to result in some of the aforementioned layoffs occurring earlier than anticipated, although the customer has not yet supplied sufficient information to enable Lipari to identify affected employees. Lipari will continue to keep your office apprised of information relevant to the upcoming layoffs, as required by law. There is no Lipari ( or I&K) policy creating any transfer, bumping, or reassignment rights for employees terminated in connection with this layoff, and there is no union at this facility. Affected employees have also been notified of the pending layoffs, as required by WARN. If you have any questions, feel free to contact Brian A. Zilo, Director of Human Resources at (586) 563-2888. 6e:1;~G. Brian A.
