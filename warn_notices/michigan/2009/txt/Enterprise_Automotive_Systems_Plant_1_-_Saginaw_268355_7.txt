EAS was engaged in negotiations with a potential buyer that would have enabled EAS to continue operations at this facility. However, on January 29, 2009 those negotiations terminated without reaching a sale agreement. A short time before this decision, at the request of its lender, EAS sought legal counsel to prepare a contingency plan. Subsequent to its retention of counsel, EAS had contacted both its major secured creditor and its major customers in an effort to obtain the financing necessary to continue operations at this facility. Despite these efforts, EAS' inability to obtain the necessary financing to continue operations has forced it to liquidate its assets and regrettably, order the closing of the facility. This scheduled closing will affect all employees at the facilities located at the address above. Because there are fewer than 50 employees we do not believe the provisions of theWorker Adjustment and Retraining Act, 29 U.S.C. 1201 et seq (the "WARN Act") apply; however, we have provided this notice out of an abundance of caution and in an effort to provide the affected employees with notice of the closing in a manner contemplated by the WARN Act. #10538077 vl (!3'7n.2) "EXCELLENCE THPIDUCiH INNDVF'tTIDN" The Plant closures will be pennanent. Bumping rights v.'ill not be afforded. Employment separations will begin on May l, 2009 and continue until June 1, 2009. Employees in all job classifications will be affected. We are providing a list of the job classifications with the number of affected employees in each classification. In addition to providing this notice, we have provided notice of the closing to the employee's union, IAW & AW, District Lodge 60, AFL-CIO, through their union representative, Bobby Atanasovski, Business Representative, IA W & AW, District Lodge 60, AFL-CIO, One Heritage Place, Suite 550, Southgate, MI 48195. For further information, please contact me at 586. 755.3180. Sincerely, ~>.~ Rich S.
