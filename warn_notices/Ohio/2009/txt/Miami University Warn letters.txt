Fifty-five (55) currently filled positions will be eliminated beginning June 30, 2009. Classified (hourly, non-bargaining unit) employees will be afforded bumping and recall rights based on the University's civil service rules. Hourly bargaining unit employees' bumping and recall rights are governed by the applicable provisions in the AFSCME collective bargaining agreement. Miami University -Oxford bargaining unit employees are represented by AFSCME Local 209. The president of the local union is Mattie Gray, and her address is Miami University, East End Building, Oxford, Ohio 45056. Unclassified (salaried) employees with more than five years of service have rights to a period of professional leave after their active employment terminates. Unclassified employees do not have bumping or recall rights. In addition to these position eliminations, the University is selling the assets of its software unit, redLantem, to CollegeSource, Inc. As a result of the sale, the University will terminate the positions of twenty-seven (27) employees who are assigned to the redLantem unit on June 30, 2009. We anticipate that many of these employees will be offered employment with CollegeSource, Inc. CollegeSource, Inc., a California-based company, will operate redLantem out of its current Oxford location for up to 18 months and intends to keep the redLantem operation in the region thereafter. The University also intends to transfer the operations of our public radio station, WMUB, to Cincinnati Public Radio. As a consequence, the University will terminate the positions often (10) employees who are assigned to WMUB. The Honorable Prudence Dana March 3, 2009 Page 2 A list of all the affected positions is attached. Miami University intends to offer outplacement and transition services to all affected employees. It is our hope that these programs will aid all employees in the transition to new employment. If you need additional information or have any questions, please contact me at 529-4226 or at the address listed above. Sincerely, David Creamer Vice President for Finance and Business Services and Treasurer Enclosure , " l -.';Pe""_ ... Oxford Campus <<vacant>> Accounting Associate $26,074.00
