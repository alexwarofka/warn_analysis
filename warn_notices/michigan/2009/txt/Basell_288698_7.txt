Re: Notice Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining (WARN) Act 
Dear Sirs/Madams: 
Basell USA Inc. (the "Company'') has recently decided that it will be necessary to reduce its workforce at 
its Wilmington facility located at Delaware Corporate Center II, 2 Righter Parkway, Suite 300,

permanently eliminated. 
These eliminations are scheduled to begin on August 23, 2009 and will be completed by August 27, 2009. 
The reduction is expected to be permanent and no bumping rights exist. You will find enclosed a list of 
affected job titles with the number of employees in each job classification. 
This notice is intended to comply with the Company's notice obligations, if any, under the federal Worker 
Adjustment & Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, 29 USC ¤¤2101-2109. The giving of this notice, 
however, shall not constitute an acknowledgement by the Company of any obi igations under the WARN 
Act in the event the effects of the reduction are such that the WARN Act requirements do not apply. The 
information in this notice is based upon the best information available to the Company as of the date of 
this notice.
