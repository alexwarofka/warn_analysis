-ссr :.:zs February 22, 2012 Via Email and U.S. Mail , <1; Ms. Kathy Maybriar, Bureau Chief Office of Workforce Development Ohio Department of Job & Family Services 4020 East Fifth A venue P.O. Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216-1618 kathy .maybriar@jfs.ohio.gov Dear Ms. Maybriar: This letter constitutes notice under the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retaining Notification Act ("WARN"), 29 U.S.C. д 2101 et. seq. and the Ohio Unemployment Compensation Law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann.д 4141.28(C), that there may be a "mass layoff' , as defined by WARN , at the WUPW Broadcasting Station (FOX Toledo) located at 433 North Summit Street , Toledo, OH 43604. The layoff noted above would be the result of a transaction pursuant to which TVL Broadcasting , Inc. will sell the WUPW Broadcasting Station to WUPW, LLC (the "Sale"). The Sale is subject to regulatory approval, and thus, the job eliminations are contingent upon the receipt of such approval and the closing of the Sale. We currently expect to receive regulatory approval and close the Sale between April 24, 2012 and May 8, 2012 . The job eliminations, which we expect will affect sixty-three (63) employees and will be permanent, would occur within this period. Affected employees do not have bumping rights and none of them are represented by a union. The buyer of WUPW may be hiring some or all of the employees affected by the Sale, but at the time of this notice we have no way of knowing how many employees , if any , the buyer will hire. Should you have any questions, please contact Dan Donohue at 401-457-9402. Sincerely,
