Accordingly, the Company will be terminating affected employees from their employment at the time of closing of the facility which is anticipated to occur on or about March 6, 2012. All affected employees work out of the Company's facility located at 3509 Embassy Parkway Suite 102, Fairlawn, OH 44333. 35 employees in total will be affected. This action is expected to be permanent. There are no bumping rights. If you require further information, you may contact me at 646-485-6635. This notice is being provided as a courtesy since the number of employees impacted may not meet the threshold for requiring notice. As such, by providing this notice AISS is not waiving any right to assert that some or all of the potential separations do not require sixty (60) days notice under federal law. Sincerely, S1erlin9 / 2,49 \/Vest 17th tei:2127365!00 I fax:212736068:3 /
