As you also know, OSU extended these contracts through July 31, 2012. The purpose of this letter is to let you know that VGS, Inc. was just informed that OSU has now again extended these contracts through August 31, 2012. As we previously informed you, up until the beginning of July, VOS, Inc. believed that the contracts would, in fact, be fully renewed. VGS, Inc, has attempted to avoid any unnecessary disruption to its workforce throughout this process. Based upon a meeting with OSU on July 5, 2012, however, VGS, Inc. is no longer certain that the contracts will be fully renewed. Despite this unforeseen and unexpected development, VGS, Inc.'s pursuit of renewed contracts with OSU is on-going. In the event of non-renewal, VOS, Inc. will permanently cease providing services at the locations listed above as soon as August 31, 2012, or within fourteen (14) days thereafter. As a result, the employment of all 143 VGS, Inc. employees working at OSU would be permanently terminated as soon as August 31, 2012, or within fourteen (14) days thereafter. Should you have any other questions, please contact Brian Barker at (614) 291-0233. Sincerely, VGS, Inc. {3903412:}
