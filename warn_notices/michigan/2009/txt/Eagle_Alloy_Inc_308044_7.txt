Ms Chong-Anna, Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, we hereby notify you that Eagle Alloy, 5142 Evanston Avenue. Muskegon. Michigan has experienced a totally unexpected lengthy downturn in business that has resulted in a longer than expected temporary layoff of a number of employees. On May 11, 2009 we restructured for what we expected to be a relatively short lived downturn. At that time we temporarily laid off 145 workers of approximately 262 employees. Subsequently we have brought back 12of these. Unforeseeable business circumstances have required us to extend the temporary layoff potentially longer than six months, hence the notification. We have not lost any customers. In fact, our new pattern orders have increased 7% over last year. These are precursors to increased business but orders have yet to be forthcoming. We believe we are seeing a slight uptick in orders indicating that the worst is over. Our customers have reduced their inventories to historically low levels and are beginning to order to replenish stock. We fully expect to invite aUlaid off employees back as soon as customer orders ju~'tify it. Should you have any questions. don~t hesitate to call me at 231-788-235 I, or
