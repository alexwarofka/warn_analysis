i I NOTICE OF FACILITY CLOSING January 13, 2011 State of Michigan Rapid Response Section 201 North Washington Square Victor Office Center, 3rd Floor Lansing, MI 48913 Dear Sir/Madame: This notice is being given to you pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, pursuant to 29 USC¤ 2101 et seq., which requires employers to give official notice to certain governmental units or officials of a pending facility shutdown. Continental Plastics Company and its affiliate companies have been experiencing a general economic downturn and lack of work to justify the continued existence of the plant in Benzonia. As a result of this economic downturn, it is expected that our corporate facility/plant located at 2532 Benzie Highway, Benzonia, Michigan will be permanently closed in the near future. We are currently involved in negotiations with several companies who have expressed an interest in buying this and other facilities owned by Continental Plastics or its affiliates. It is possible that this facility, together with others may be purchased by a third party. We are hopeful that the Buyer may in fact seek to hire the workforce and perhaps lease the facility, but there is no way to be assured of that result. While the exact date has not been established for this closure, it is anticipated that the Company and its affiliate companies may close its operations as early as March 18, 2011. If you should have any questions, please contact Russ Thomas at Continental Plastics Company at (586) 294-4600. Sincerely, ,,.----~ ,á .-...i ,., ,f,.\ .. _.>lj-""'"""" .. -e '1,. ~,A,.,...,-,r.__.;RECEIVEDIN Russ Thomas CONTINENTAL INDUSTRIES, LLC JAN 18 2011 RAPIDRESPONSE 33525 Groesbeck Hwy. ¥ Fraser, Michigan 48026 ¥ Tel 586/294-4600 ¥ Fax 586/294-3317
