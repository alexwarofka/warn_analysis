Dear Sir or Madam: The purpose of this letter is to inform you Influent has decided to rescind in its entirety the plant closing notice issued on March 2, 2011 concerning the Call Center located at 27851 State Route 7, Marietta, Ohio. Influent no longer intends to close the Call Center on May 2, 2011 or the 14-day period thereafter. Influent is rescinding the plant closing notice due to intervening business circumstances which have caused the Company to reevaluate its business options. We have notified the employees of this decision. We will keep you informed if there are any developments in the future warranting your attention or involvement. We deeply appreciate the efforts you made up to this point on behalf of our employees. If you have any questions or would like additional information, please feel free to call Lori Colussi-Junk, at 614-280-1600, ext. 3008. Very truly yours,
