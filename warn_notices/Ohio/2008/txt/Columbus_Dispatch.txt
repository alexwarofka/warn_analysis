Coleman Office of the Mayor City of Columbus City Hall, 2nd Floor 90 West Broad Street Columbus, Ohio 43215 Dear Mayor Coleman: Dispatch Printing Company ("Company") has developed tentative plans that would result in a workforce reduction among certain employees working at the Company facility located at 5300 Crosswind Drive, Columbus, Ohio 43228. We expect these reductions, when finalized, will be permanent. At this time, we anticipate that these employees will be laid off or have their employment terminated on or about November 3, 2008, or in the 14-day period that begins on that date, provided there is an appropriate decision from an arbitrator after an arbitration hearing that is scheduled to begin August 27, 2008. The number and job titles affected are attached to this letter as Attachment 1. This announcement and the above timetable are based on the best information currently available. However, various factors may still affect the timing of any employment terminations. You will be advised of any significant changes in these plans, if any, as additional information becomes available. Many of the affected employees are represented by a union. The union has been notified by separate letter of these plans. The following is the name and address of the union involved: Mr. Gordon McGinnis 
Secretary-Treasurer and Business Agent 
Teamsters Union Local 473 
6511 Eastland Road -Suite 140 
Brook Park, Ohio 44142 
Any bumping rights for union-represented employees would be covered by applicable union agreements with the Company. Bumping arrangements are not available for affected non-union represented employees. To the extent that the separations described above may be included within a covered event under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, this letter is intended to fulfill any requirements imposed under the Act. By providing this information, the Company does not concede that the Act applies or that notice is otherwise required. The Company already has provided each affected employee with notification intending to fulfill any requirements under the Act. If you have any questions about this announcement, please contact me at 614-469-6229. Sincerely, Dispatch Printing Company 4:~~atb«:::~m1JJtu
