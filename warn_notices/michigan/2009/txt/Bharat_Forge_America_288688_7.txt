BHARAT FORGE AMERICA 
June 18, 2009 RECEIVED Chong-Anna Canfora, Director Rapid Response Section Michigan Department of Labor & Economic Growth JUN222009 611 West Ottawa Street, 4th Floor PO Box 30004 Lansing, Ml 48909 RAPID RESRONSE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS Dear Ms. Canfora: This notice is being provided to you pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. ¤ 2101 cáwARN"). Please be advised that Bharat Forge America, located at 2807 South Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, Lansing, Michigan, 48910, will be laying off employees for at least six (6) months. Please note that Bharat Forge America intends to continue operations at this facility but at a reduced level. Currently, 106 employees are currently on temporary layoff and the Company had expected to be able to recall those employees in the near future. Importantly, although the Company would have preferred to provide employees with sixty (60) days advance notice as required by the WARN Act, it has just become clear that the current temporary layoffs are likely permanent, or at least will last longer than six (6) months. Moreover, although the Company is not able al this lime to specifically identify any additional layoffs, it is possible that additional employees may also be laid off on a permanent and/or long-term basis. Bharat Forge America regrets that these long-term layoffs must occur. However, over 80 percent of the Company's business is directly connected to the automotive market and another 20 percent the truck market. The unpredictable, severe and significant decline in these markets has caused an unexpected and unforeseen reduction in orders. This loss of business has resulted in excessive inventories and diminished production requirements and caused the temporary layoffs to become permanent and/or long-term. Under the WARN Act, the sixty (60) day notice period may be shortened due to such unforeseen business circumstances. The temporary layoffs mentioned above occurred on between September 8, 2008 and May 29, 2009. Listed below is an itemization of the positions affected and the number of employees in each position: Position No. of Employees Date of Initial Layoff HI 2 9/8/2008
