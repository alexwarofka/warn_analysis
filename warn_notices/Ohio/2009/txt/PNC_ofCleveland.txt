Dear Mr. Valentine: This letter is to inform you of a second, separate site of employment for which PNC is required to provide your office with notice of a "plant closing" under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"). On December 31, 2008, the legal merger of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., ("PNC") and National City Corporation (''National City") was completed. The merger of the two organizations and conversion of our systems results in certain redundancies between National City and PNC operations, which in tum results in the need to restructure certain of our businesses and departments, and the elimination of certain businesses that are inconsistent with our business model going forward. WARN, requires that we notify you if either a "plant closing" or a "mass layoff' occurs at any covered site of employment. This letter is to inform you that the elimination of certain business units at our 4100 West 1501h Street, Cleveland, Ohio location constitutes a "plant closing" under WARN -even though PNC will continue to employ well over 1,000 employees at that location. Specifically, we have determined that 72 positions at the 4100 West 1501h Street, Cleveland, Ohio location will be eliminated as a result of "plant closings" at that location. The following information is provided as required under WARN. 1. For purpose of this notice only, we have concluded that the relevant affected employment site is 4100 West 1501 h Street, Cleveland, Ohio. The name and telephone number of the company official to contact for further information is Brian Ferguson, Vice President, Human Resources (412) 768-8500. 2. The displacements occurring as a result of the merger are expected to be permanent. 3. Unless they obtain employment elsewhere within PNC or with another employer prior to their expected date of displacement, the employment of 72 employees at the Cleveland, Ohio location is expected to be terminated according to the following schedule: During the 14-day period beginning on October 2, 2009 20 employees During the 14-day period beginning on October 5, 2009 I employee The PNC Financial Services Group One PNC Plaza 249 Fifth Avenue Pittsburgh Pennsylvania 15222 2707 www.pnc.com Mr. Valentine July 31, 2009 Page2 During the 14-day period beginning on October 30, 2009 3 7 employees
