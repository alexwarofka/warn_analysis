As part of these efforts, our entire facility located at 3160 Dallavo Court, Walled Lake, Michigan, permanently closed on April 16, 2009. At the same time, the Company sold some of the facility's assets to Center Manufacturing CV, Inc., "Purchaser," on April 16th, and Purchaser is expected to operate certain functions at the site, and retain a portion of the employees, for the ensuing 45 days. Therefore, all Conteeh positions and jobs at the facility either have been eliminated or will be eliminated by the conclusion of the 4 5-day post-sale period. It is anticipated that 196 employees will be affected the closure of the Walled Lake facility. Attached is a list of the affected positions and the number of employees holding each position. Affected employees were not represented by a union, and have no bumping rights. Contech took a number of steps to avoid the shutdown, including negotiating with the Purchaser to structure a sale of the entire facility with all employee positions intact after the sale. To our disappointment, we were only able to negotiate for the Purchaser to retain a portion of the employees for the 45-day post-sale period. The remaining employees had to be terminated effective April 16th. We were unable to give at least 60 days advance notice of the shutdown because, for months, we actively have been trying to raise sufficient capital and generate business that would have enabled us to continue in business and avoid this shutdown, and earlier notice would have undermined those efforts. Our potential sources of capital or business only recently failed, and we first learned late on April 16th from the Purchaser which employees will be retained after the sale. Should you have any questions, please contact Ralph Turner, Director of Human Resources, at 269.327.9990. Job Category
