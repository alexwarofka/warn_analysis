The merger of the two organizations and conversion of our systems results in certain redundancies between National City and PNC operations. The possible ''plant closing" at the Royal Oak facility results primarily from PNC's decision to consolidate the work performed by several business segments at that location into other centralized PNC locations. Below is information relating to 29 additional positions that will be eliminated at the Royal Oak location. Together with the 71 position eliminations we communicated earlier, PNC has currently determined that a total of I 00 positions will be eliminated as a result of a "plant closing'' at the Royal Oak facility. 1. For purpose of this update only, we have conc1uded that the relevant affected employment site is 400 West Fourth Street, Royal Oak, Michigan. The name and telephone number of the company official to contact for further information is Brian Ferguson (412) 768-8500. 2. The displacements occurring as a result of the merger are expected to be pennanent. 3. Unless the employees obtain employment elsewhere within PNC or with another employer prior to their expected date of displacement, the employment of the 29 additional employees at the Royal Oak, Michigan location is expected to be terminated during the 14-day period beginning on July 9, 2010. The PNC Financial Services Group One PNC Plaza 249 Fifth Avenue Pittsburgh Pennsylvania 15222 2707 www.pnc.com
