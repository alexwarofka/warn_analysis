Fifth A venue Columbus, OH 43219 RE: Notice of Permanent Layoffs and Temporary Reassignments at Invacare Taylor Stree:(in ~iia, Ohio .. . сo 'c.)i_:~ Dear Ms. Maybriar: This notice is being provided to you pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN"). On or about December 27, 2012, Invacare Corporation commenced a Mass Layoff, as defined under WARN, of certain positions at it Taylor Street facility located atl200 Taylor Street in Elyria, Ohio. Invacare entered into a Consent Decree of Injunction with the Food and Drug Administration, which was filed with the U.S. District Court in Cleveland, Ohio, regarding operations at Invacare's Taylor Street and Corporate Headquarter facilities, at 1200 Taylor Street, Elyria, Ohio and One Invacare Way, Elyria, Ohio, respectively. As part of the Consent Decree, unfortunately Invacare must immediately suspend and/or cease certain operations at its Taylor Street facility which results in the immediate layoff of 143 employees and the temporary reassignment of approximately 113 employees, effective today. If an employee is not recalled to their position within 60 days of the layoff, the layoff will be considered permanent. As a result and because Invacare could not anticipate the resolution of the Consent Decree with FDA and its impact, Invacare has notified the affected employees that each will receive a lump sum payment equal to the amount each would have received if it were able to provide the 60 day Notice. This amount will be paid within three weeks of the layoffs. In addition, Invacare will continue the employees' benefit programs during the 60 day period. A table reflecting likely affected positions is attached hereto. Employees do not have bumping rights, and none of the affected employees is represented by a union. Should you have any questions, please call me at (440) 329-6735. Sincerely, Pc"kuuJv)<1,-.Patricia Stumpp f'Ui v-v-(j r SVP, Human Resources INVACARE CORPORATION One Invacare Way PO Box 4028 Elyria.
