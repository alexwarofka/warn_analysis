Case No.: 08-15012 
Dear Ms. Patton: Please be advised that the undersigned is currently serving as Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Trustee in the matter of Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals, case number 08-15012. The Berkeley Company is currently operating as a going concern and there are pending pleadings in the Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Ohio Western Division for the sale of the company also is a going concern. By necessity, the sale process in a bankruptcy setting has to be directed towards higher and better bids and, therefore, while we presently have an offer that provides for the company to remain in its current location and maintain its current workforce, out of an abundance of caution, we have provided the required WARN letters to employees. A copy of the letter and information is enclosed for your reference. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact the undersigned. RDN/kmb

For Life! October 31, 2008 Dear Employee: As you are aware, Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals, Inc. intends to sell its business assets and operations pursuant to a Bankruptcy Court approved auction process. Although Berkeley has entered into a Letter of Intent with an investor who intends to maintain the current facility and a substantial portion of the current employees, Berkeley is still subject to higher bids by other parties, putting Berkeley at risk for layoffs. We are required to give you notice of the potential for a mass layoff of current employees in accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"). While we are extremely hopeful that new ownership will result in continued employment at Berkeley, there is a possibility that a substantial number of Berkeley employees will be laid off immediately before or following the sale of Berkeley's assets. In the instance of a layoff, it is expected to take place on or about December 31, 2008. However, there is also a possibility that a substantial number of employees will be subsequently re-employed by the new owner. Again, this notice is a precautionary measure to allow employees the opporturiity to seek and/or secure employment with another employer in the event of a mass layoff.-$ We thank you for your patience and dedication as we go through these uncertain times. For further information, please contact Rick Nelson at (513) 333-5255. Sincerely, 0 S;y:Il8Xiaá 1576765_1 WARN Letter Attachment Current Berkeley Employees: 191 40 -salary 151 -hourly as of 10/31/2008 481371.l
