Please note that at this time, Quality Spring/Togo does not intend to close entirely. Currently, twenty-eight (28) employees are on indefinite layoff. Although a few of those employ-are expected to be recalled, the majority will remain on Indefinite layoff for at least six (6) months. Furthermore, approximately thirty-five (35) production employees and eight (8) office employees will also be laid off for at least six (6) months. Importantly, although the Company would have preferred to provide employees with sixty (60) days advance notice as required by the WARN Act, It has just become clear that these layoffs must occur. Moreover, although the Company is not able at this time to specifically identify any additional layoffs, It Is possible that additional employ-may also be laid off on a permanent and/or long-term basis. Quality Spring Togo regrets that these long-term layoffs must occur.
