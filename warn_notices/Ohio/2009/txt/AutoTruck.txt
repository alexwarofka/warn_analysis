Box 1618  Columbus , Ohio 43216-1618  Dear Ms. Maybriar: The following is a notice of a possible plant closing pursuant to the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), Department of Labor Regulations (20 CFR part 639). Auto Truck Transport USA, Inc. ("ATT") is issuing this notice for purely precautionary reasons, as the plant closing would only be necessary if A TT's contract with its long-time customer, Navistar , is not renewed . The Navistar contract expires on December 31, 2009. While A TT and Navistar are continuing to negotiate a renewal or extension of the agreement , A TT recently became aware for the first time that Navistar is considering alternate vendors. Please be advised that ATT's Springfield facility located at 6370 Urbana Road, Springfield, OH 45502 may issue a plant closing, which if it occurs, will occur between December 31, 2009 and January 13, 2010. It is estimated that the plant closing will affect approximately 186 union and non-union employees. Due to the unforeseen business circumstance, described above, it is possible that the plant closing may occur less than 60 days after the date of this notice, which is less than the notice period generally required by WARN. A TT believes, however, in its best business judgment that it is appropriate to give this precautionary notice now and that such a notice would not have been appropriate at any earlier date . If the plant closing occurs, at the present time, it is expected that it would be permanent. We do presently anticipate the closing of the entire employment site located at 6370 Urbana Road, Springfield, OH 45502. Affected employees will be paid any earned wages and agreed upon benefits. Those non-union employees affected by the plant closing have no automatic transfer or bumping rights to another facility . Union employees of Local Lodge 121that are affected by the plant closing are restricted to the automatic transfer or bumping rights contained within the collective bargaining agreement. [rag e I of1 ) PO Box 58/046 е 10801 Corporate Drive е Pleasant Prairie, WI 53158 ....,,...., p -,~.The affected union employees' collective bargaining representative has been notified of the possible plant closing, including the anticipated date the union employees' employment will cease.
