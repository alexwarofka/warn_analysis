Box 30004 Lansing, MI 48909 Re: The Brown Company of Ionia, LLC; Notice of Permane11t Layoffs Dear Director Canfora: The Brown Company of Ionia, LLC's production facilities at 294, 314 and 336 S. Steele Street, Ionia, MI 48846, will permanently layoff approximately 139 employees on November 6, 2009. No bumping rights exist with respect to these employees; The Brown Company of Ionia, LLC is non-union. These permanent layoffs are the result of Brown's failure to obtain additional capital and business over the last few months. Brown has been actively seeking capital and business that wou!d have been sufficient, if obtained, to avoid these permanent layoffs. Brown could not give WARN notice earlier because to do so would have compromised Brown's ability to obtain the l:api•al and business it was seeking. When Brown's efforts to obtain additional capital and business failed, it had little choice but to agree to sell the Company to Matcor. The Brown Company has prepared, and will make available upon request, a listing of the job titles and positions to be affected and the number of affected employees iri each position. If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact me at (616) 527-1600. Sincerely, /kjj~~ RECEIVF.I) Buzz Benr,ett Plant Manager NOVOg . ,Ji'·J THE BROWN COMPANY OF IONIA, LLC. RAPID Rt:. .t: WORKFOF,_ ,'RuGRAMS
