Beckhorn: Hostess Brands, Inc. (including its affiliate Interstate Brands Corporation, "Hostess" or the "Company") filed for chapter 11 relief on January 11, 2012 (the "Filing"). TI1e Company has been actively engaged in discussions ,v:ith various lenders and potential purchasers regarding Hostess' restructuring both before and after the Filing. Our primary focus is to complete our restructuring of the Company and emerge from chapter 1 á1 as a viable company. However, it is possible that, despite our best efforts, certain events may occur that would require Hostess to sell all or portions of its business and/ or wind down its operations and liquidate. Despite the uncertainty of what may happen, the federal \,forker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and certain related State statutes (collectively, "\\1ARN") generally require employers to provide advance notice in the event of certain covered employment actions. To comply wjth any \VARN obligations Hostess may have, this letter is intended to give you conditional notice that, based upon the best information reasonably available to Hostess at this time, it is possible that one of the following events tna)' occm: ¥ 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, the pursuit of a sale of all or a 
substantial portion of all of Hostess' assets; 
¥ 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, Hostess to stop pursuing the 
restructuring of its business; 
¥ 	J\fore than 20% of Hostess' aggregate workforce is laid off after.January 11, 2012; ¥ 	Hostess receives an unsatisfactory resolution of it;; pending motion before the bankmptcy court regarding certain modifications to its collective bargaining agreements with the Bakers and/or the Teamsters; ¥ 	There is a strike, walkout, lockout, slowdown or other work stoppage that is likely to have a material 6031 Connection Drive, Irving, TX 75039 -(972) 532-4500 adverse effect on Hostess; or ¥ 	Hostess seeks bankruptcy court approval to commence a sale of property while in bankruptcy which accounts for more than 20% of Hostess' consolidated net sales as reported on Hostess' financial statements for the twelve-month period precedingJanuary 11, 2012. If one of these events occurs, Hostess may begin the process of permanently ceasing operations, and significantly scaling down operations at its Jackson !vII-3791 Ann Arbor Rd located at 3791 Ann Arbor Road,.Jackson, ]\.fl 49202-2729, as early as 60 days from the receipt of this notice. In such fill event, Hostess currentl}' expects substantially all employee separations to occur within 60 days of tl1e receipt of this notice or within a 14-day period thereafter. At the end of this process, the entire Jackson i'vII -3791 Ann Arbor Rd would be permanently closed. There will be no bumping rights available to employees in this circumstance. A listing of the job titles of the positions that we would expect to be affected, and the names of the employees in each of those job classifications is attached as Attachment A Some of tl1e affected employees are represented by one of the twelve unions listed below.
