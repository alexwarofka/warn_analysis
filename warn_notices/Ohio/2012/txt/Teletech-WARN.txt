The affected employees at the Site are being notified. on July 17, 2012. Tele Tech provides customer service to the customers of its corporate clients. Unfortunately, current business needs are forcing our client to reassess its overall outsourcing arrangement and to switch to an internal customer service solution. This development will result in TeleTech having to eliminate 217 Customer Service Agent positions and 30 General & Administrative positions at the Site. The position eliminations will occur on September 15, 2012. There are no bumping rights that exist with regard to these positions and the elimination of these positions is expected to be permanent. Employees at the Site are not represented by a union. TeleTech regrets having to conduct this layoff If you have any questions regarding this letter, please call me at your convenience at 303-397-8228 or Sarah Chouinard, Director of Human Capital, at 303-397-9122.
