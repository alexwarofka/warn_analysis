(Employer Tax ID No. 36-1264810) ("Navistar") anticipates that it will cease essentially all operations for some period of time at its Truck Specialty Center ("TSC") located at 5975 Urbana Road, Springfield, OH, 45502, in Clark County. If this action is taken as currently anticipated, Navistar is hereby giving notice that approximately 55 to 63 out of the 63 currently active employees at the TSC who are represented for purposes of collective bargaining by either UAW Local 402 or UAW Local 658 would be laid off effective on or about October 4, 2010. The attached document lists the job titles that are likely to be affected by this action, and the number of affected employees in each job. Because all operations at the TSC will cease, the affected employees will have no bumping rights. The contact information for Local 402 and Local 658 is as follows: United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) Local 402 Jason Barlow (President) R.S. Thaxton (Chairman) 3671 Urbana Road Springfield, Ohio 45502 United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) Local 658 Steve Overturf (President) S.A. Carnes (Chairperson) 3671 Urbana Road Springfield, Ohio 45502 This action is currently anticipated to be temporary in nature. At this time, however, Navistar cannot reasonably predict the duration of the resulting layoff. To the extent that Navistar's actions may constitute a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" as those terms are defined by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("the WARN Act"), this letter is intended to fulfill any notice or other requirements imposed by the WARN Act, 451852,] applicable WARN regulations, or the Ohio Unemployment Compensation Law. By providing this notice, Navistar does not intend to concede that the WARN Act applies to this anticipated action or that notice is otherwise legally required. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me directly at (937)390-4250 . .сс,_(L__ oward~borne Manager, Human Resources Springfield Operations JobCode  Oeler  Impacted I Outof Plant  27099  TSC Clerk  1  27100  TSC Accounting Clerk  2  Total Impacted 3
