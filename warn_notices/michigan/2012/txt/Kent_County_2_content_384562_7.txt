Chair, Kent County Board of Conllllissione1-s Kent County Administration 300 Monroe .Ave N\\1, Grand Rapids, 1H 49503 Re: 	Conditional Notice Pursuant to the \Vorker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act Dear ]\Is. Beckhorn: Hostess Brands, Inc. (including its affiliate Interstate Brands C01poration, "Hostess" or the "Company") filed for chapter 11 relief on January 11, 2012 (the "Piling"). The Company has been actively engaged in discussions with various lenders and potential purchasers regarding Hostess' restructuring both before and after the Piling. Our primary focus is to complete our restructuring of the Company and emerge from chapter 11 as a viable company. However, it is possible that, despite our best efforts, certain events may occur that would require Hostess to sell all or portions of its business and/ or wind down its operations and liquidate. Despite the uncertainty of what may happen, the federal \\forker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and certain re-lated State statutes (collcctivdy, "\X'ARN") generally rec1uirc employers to provide advance notice in the event of certain covered employment actions. To comply with any WT.AR.t"\J obligations Hostess may have, this letter is intended to give you conditional notice that, based upon the best information reasonably available to Hostess at this time, it is possible that one of the following events may occur: • 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, the pursuit of a sale of all or a 
substantial portion of all of Hostess' assets; 
• 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court autho1ization for, Hostess to stop pursuing the 
restructuring of its business; 
• 	i\forc than 20% of Hostess' aggregate workforce is L'lid off after Janua1T 11, 2012; • 	Hostess receives an unsatisfactory resolution of its pending motion before the bankmptcy court regarding certain modifications to its collective bargaining agreements with the Bakers and/ or the Teamsters; • 	111ere is a strike, walkout, lockout, slowdown or other work stoppage that is likely to have a material adverse effect on Hostess; or • 	Hostess seeks bankrnptcy court approval to commence a sale of property while in bankrnptcy which accounts for more than 20% of Hostess' consolidated net sales as reported on Hostess' financial statements for the twelve-month period precedingJanua1y 11, 2012. 6031 Connection Drive, Irving, TX 75039 -(972) 532·4500 If one of these events occurs, Hostess may begin the process of permanently ceasing operations, and significantly scaling down operations at its \\'yoming MI -5960C Burlingame located at 5960 C Burlingame Ave S\,1,\,fyoming, l\H 49509-9398, as early as 60 days from the receipt of this notice. In such an event, Hostess currently expects substantially all employee separations to occur within 60 days of the receipt of tliis notice or within a ·J4-day period thereafter. At the end of this process, the entire Wyoming MI -5960C Burlingame would be permanently closed. There will be no bumping rights available to employees in tliis circumstance. A listing of the job titles of tl1e positions that we would expect to be affected, and the names of the employees 111 each of those job classifications is attached as Attachment A. Some of the affected employees are represented by one of the twelve unions listed below.
