L. 100-3~,~9 U.S.C. ¤¤ 2101 et seq., please be advised that there will be a closing lit the~derson Services/Prologix facility located at 9525 Glades Drive, Hamilton, OH 45011. This closing of the Company's operations is expected to be permanent and will result in approximately 118 employees being laid off. These layoffs are deemed to have occurred on or about February 11, 2009, or during the 14-day period thereafter. Bumping rights will not exist. The affected employees are not represented by a union. It is hoped that the facility's operations may be sold and these employees' employment may continue with a successor employer. This shortened notice was provided because of business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable, specifically the unexpected failure of the Company's sole customer to obtain necessary business commitments from the publishing community and its retail base. Although the customer was ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining these commitments, any earlier notice would have precluded any meaningful negotiations with the publishers and retailers to obtain the necessary business commitments. The job titles and the number of affected employees in each job classification are as follows: If you have any questions, you may contact Bo Castle at (865) 584-9765 ext. 1333.
