Wellington-Almont L.L.C. 3776 Van Dyke¥ Almont, Michigan 48003 ¥ (810) 798-3921 ¥ Fax (810) 798-8193 January 9, 2009 TO: ALL WELLINGTON ALMONT, LLC EMPLOYEES NOTICE OF PLANT CLOSING Dear Employee: Unfortunately, due to the state of the economy and the impact it has had on our customers , we have made the very difficult decision to close the Almont plant. The plant will close as of March 15, 2009 . Under a federal law called "WARN ," we are required to provide you with notice of the plant closure. We are also required to provide notice to the State of Michigan and to the Village of Almont. We are providing separate notices to both of those entities and are also providing them with a copy of this letter. Also under the WARN law, we are required to provide you with the following information : I. This will be a permanent closure of the entire Almont plant . 2. All employees will be permanently laid-off as of March 15, 2009. 3. There are no bumping rights. 4. For further information and assistance, please contact Gary Sievert, Director of Human Resources, at histelephone number of(734) 942-1060, ext. 212, or his office address of 39555 I-94 S. Service Drive, Belleville , Michigan 48111. Currently , there are 108 employees at the Almont plant. As you know, due to customer plant shutdowns and lower releases from customers , the majority of employees were temporarily laid-off in December . Because of further customer plant shutdowns and even lower releases, the temporary layoffs will continue longer than originally planned . As individuals are needed to help produce and ship product to customers , they will be contacted by telephone to return to work from the temporary layoff. However, all employees will be permanently laid off as of March 15, 2009 . Between now and March 15, we will keep your health insurance in place . However , the health insurance plan will be discontinued as of March 15, 2009 when the plant closes. You will be provided with information regarding the possibility of purchasing health care insurance directly from Blue Cross Blue Shield, contingent upon Blue Cross Blue Shield being willing to engage in that undertaking. We are truly sony to have to provide you with this information but, unfortunately, in our business judgment, there is no alternative. This is one of the hardest business decisions the Company has ever had to make, and we have done so most reluctantly . Sincerely, John Brodowsky President  cc:  Village of Almont, Attn: Village of Almont, Attn: Michigan Dept. ofLabor,  Steven Schneider, Village President Gerald Oakes, Village Manager Attn: Chong-Anna Canfora, Director  Employee DALE JOSHUA MARIE WILLIAM JESSICA JENNIFER TAMIE THOMAS RANDY TODD ELIZABETH KELLY NICHOLAS SUSAN ROBERT MAYLYNN ROBERT REBECCA RAYMOND KENNETH RICHARD MICHAEL CHRISTIAN BEVERLY THOMAS TIMOTHY JOHN MARY TERRY JEFFREY CHARLES STEVEN NANCY PATRICIA MICHAEL MARK ROLLIE SHELLY SARENA EARL GARY JEREMY PHILIP ERIC JESSICA BRYAN MARGARET ANDREA RONALD RANDY JACKLYN hrpa~roll ANDERSON APPENZELLER ARMSTRONG AUSTIN BEENS BENAGLIO BLUTHARDT BOND BOOMS BORCK BOWMAN BRAMBLE BRINKER BRINKER .
