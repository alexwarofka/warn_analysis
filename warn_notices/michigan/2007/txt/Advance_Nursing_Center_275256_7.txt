Washington Square Lansing, Michigan 48913 Re: WARN Act Notification Dear Ms. Hennessey: Please allow this letter to serve as written notification that on December 23, 2007 Advance Nursing Center, located at 2936 John Daly, Inkster, Michigan is scheduled to permanently close operations. Because the Center does not have at least one hundred (l 00) employees, the WARN Act does not apply to this action. However, we believed you would still wish to be apprised of the situation. This notice could not have been sent earlier because the Center only recently learned that it would no longer be receiving the State funding necessary to continue operations. As a result of the closing, Advance Nursing will experience an employment loss of approximately 78 employees. All positions at the Center will be eliminated as of December 23, 2007 , and we expect the employment losses to occur over a fourteen day (14) day period beginning November 30, 2007 . No displacement or bumping rights exist. Some of the Center's employees are represented by the Nursing & Convalescent Horne Employees Division of Local 79, Service Employees International Union AFL-CIO. The chief elected official of that union is Ms. Sharon Harris . Her address is 2604 Fourth, Detroit, MI 48202 . Should you have any questions regarding the above information, or should you require further information, please feel free to contact Robert Giddings at l-734-421-3300. Sincerely, RECEl\!ED Kristin Allee Administrator  NOV2 6 20Ut  RAPIOhl:::.-:,sáu,.~1;  WORKFORCEPROGRAMS
