Fifth A venue Columbus, Ohio 43219 Re: Notice of Mass Layoff To whom it may concern, ,_ ~" I_ 1 1 е _ On or about October 1, 2010, Navistar, Inc. (Employer Tax ID No. 36-1264810) ("Navistar") anticipates that it will cease truck assembly, subassembly and certain other related operations for some period of time at its truck assembly plant located at 6125 Urbana Road, Springfield, OH, 45502, in Clark County. If this action is taken as currently anticipated, Navistar is hereby giving notice that approximately 345 to 370 out of the 557 currently active employees at the plant who are represented for purposes of collective bargaining by either UAW Local 402 or UAW Local 658 would be laid off effective on or about October 4, 2010. The attached document lists the job titles that are likely to be affected by this action, and the number of affected employees in each job. The identity of the employees who may ultimately be affected by this action will be determined based upon certain provisions in the current applicable collective bargaining agreements which, in certain circumstances, provide senior employees in the affected jobs the opportunity to "bump" less senior employees in other bargaining unit jobs throughout the plant. The agreements further provide that this "bumping" process may be delayed by the Company for up to 30 days from the effective date of the initial layoff. The contact information for Local 402 and Local 658 is as follows: United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) Local

Kitchen (Chairperson) 3671 Urbana Road Springfield, Ohio 45502 451845.1 This action is currently anticipated to be temporary in nature. At this time, however, Navistar cannot reasonably predict the duration of the resulting layoff. To the extent that Navistar's actions may constitute a "mass layoff' or "plant closing" as those terms are defined by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("the WARN Act"), this letter is intended to fulfill any notice or other requirements imposed by the WARN Act, applicable WARN regulations, or the Ohio Unemployment Compensation Law. By providing this notice, Navistar does not intend to concede that the WARN Act applies to this anticipated action or that notice is otherwise legally required. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me directly at (937)390-4250. Manager, Human Resources
