Box 1618 ..._-,.._á.::;Columbus, Ohio 43216 )/\ .. (614) 466-9892 (telephone) l.v Kathy.Maybriar@jfs.ohio.gov Dear Ms. Maybriar: This is to inform you that, based on unforeseeable business circumstances, i.e., the sudden and unexpected loss of financing for the operations of Victory Industrial Products, LLC ("Victory") and the implications that loss of financing has on Victory's ability to continue operations, Victory has decided to permanently close its facility located at 4160 Half Acre Road, Batavia, Ohio. As a result, Victory will be eliminating all positions and terminating the employment of all employees at the Batavia facility on Wednesday, March 17, 2010. Attached is a list of the job classifications at the Batavia facility and the number of employees within each classification. Because Victory is closing the Batavia facility, the employees will not have any "bumping" rights. The employees are not represented by a union. A small number of employees may be asked to stay on for a short period of time to assist in the shut down, but at present we not know who these employees will be. This notice is being given to you pursuant to the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN"), which requires employers to give official notice to employees affected by a pending facility closure or mass layoff, and to give notice to the state dislocated workers unit and the chief elected official of the local government. Because this closure was caused by unforeseeable business circumstances, we were unable to provide you with greater advance notice. If you have any questions, please contact Sandor Jacobson at 312.629.8585. Yours truly, Eric Cohen Vice President Victory Industrial Products, LLC ..-.á' Victory Industrial Products Company Roster 3/16/2010 OH -1st shift direct 56 OH -1st shift indirect 8 OH -2nd shift direct 20 OH -2nd shift indirect 2 OH -Managers & Supervisors 6 OH -Office 31 Victory West -TX 0 Victory West -WI 2 Victory West -AZ direct 31 Victory West -AZ indirect 1 Victory West -AZ Plant Mgt 2 Victory West -AZ Office 0 Total 159
