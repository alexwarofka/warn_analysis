SPORTS & ENTF.RIAINMENT April 29, 2009 Quicken Loans Arena 100 Gateway Plaza Cleveland, OH 44115 We have been working with the Cavaliers Holdings, LLC for an extended period of time regarding the potential for ARAMARK to continue serving Quicken Loans Arena. We remain optimistic that our discussions could result in an extension to our existing business relationship. However, because at present there is no definitive agreement for ARAMARK to remain at the Quicken Loans Arena beyond June 30, 2009, we must by law send you the enclosed notice in case, and as if, no agreement is reached, ARAMARK will cease operations at Quicken Loans Arena on that date. We remain dedicated to providing excellent service at Quicken Loans Arena, hopefully for years to come. We remain equally dedicated to continuing to work with the Cavaliers Holdings, LLC and all involved parties to find a solution and reach an agreement that will allow ARAMARK to continue providing excellent service at Quicken Loans Arena beyond June 2009. While we regret having to send these notices, we truly hope that we will be able to contact you again in the very near future with news that the Cavaliers Holdings, LLC and ARAMARK have come to terms and extended our current business relationship; however, I must reiterate that in the event that an agreement is not reached with the Cavaliers Holdings, LLC, ARAMARK will cease operations on June 30, 2009. Thank you for your patience and professionalism during this challenging period. Very truly yours, ~I~~ General Manager ARAMARK SEC QUICKEN ioANS ARENA 100 GATEWAY PLAZA CLEVELAND,OH 44115 216 420 2600 FAX 216 420 2615 April 29, 2009 Rapid Response Section Bureau of WIA Ohio Department of Job and Family Services 4020 E.
