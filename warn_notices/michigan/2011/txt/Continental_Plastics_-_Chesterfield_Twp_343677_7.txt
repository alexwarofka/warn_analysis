As a result ofthis 'economic downturn, ]t is expected that our corporate' facility/plant located at 27295 Luckino Drive, Chesterfield Township, Michigan will be permanently closed in the near future. V/e are currently involved in negotiations with several companies who have expressed an interest in buying this and other facilities owned by Contine¡'tal Plastics or its affiliates. It is possible that this facility, together with others may be purchased by a third party. We are hopeful that the Buyer may in fact seek to hire the workforce and perhaps lease the facility, but there is no way to be assured of that result. á While the exact date has not been established for this closure, it is anticipated that the Company and its affiliate companies may close its operations as early as March 18, 2011.
