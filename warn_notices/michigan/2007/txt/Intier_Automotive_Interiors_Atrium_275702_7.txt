5th Floor Lansing. Ml 48913 Dear Deborah Hennessey Section Chief: Regrettably, due to our current business circumstances, Atreum Brighton has found it necessary to lay off employees from their positions at the facility located at 100 Brighton tnterior Drive, Brighton, Michigan 48116, which will be closing. Although we hope that there may be other employment opportunities for some employees, these layoffs must be considered permanent. The layoffs will initially affect 36 employees. Exact dates of the layoffs have not been determined, but they will begin no earlier than September 18, 2007 and no later than October 1 . 2007. At this time it is expected that an additional 168 employees will be laid off as lay offs will continue through November, 2007. To the extent that these layoffs constitute a "mass layoff' or "plant closing" under the V\/orker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. this letter is intended to fulfill the Act's requirements. By providing this letter, however, Atreum Brighton does not concede that the Act applies or that notices are otherwise required. For further information, please contact me at 810-225-8810. Very t.ruly yours, (}~. c/(l.l-t RECEIVED
