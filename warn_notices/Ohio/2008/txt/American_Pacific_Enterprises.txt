(the "WARN Act"), the Company is providing you with the following information: 1. 	Due to ongoing economic challenges, the Company has been seeking additional capital for the past several weeks with the goal of maintaining the current workforce and avoiding the closure of the Grove City facility. The Company was not able to notify employees earlier than today because the Company's efforts to seek additional capital would have been jeopardized by providing earlier notice to the affected employees. Unfortunately, the Company's efforts to seek additional capital have thus far been unsuccessful, and it now appears unlikely that the Company will be able to avoid the closure of the Grove City facility. 2. 	The Company currently intends to permanently close the entire facility located at 3901 Gantz Road, Grove City, Ohio 43123. 3. 	It is currently anticipated that the Company's Grove City facility may close as early as December 12, 2008. However, it is possible that the facility may remain open for some period of time after that date in order to facilitate a liquidation of the Company's operations. 4. 	The expected date of the first separation and most and/or all of the separations is December 12, 2008. 5. 	The affected employees are listed by job title on the attached document. 6. 	Bumping or seniority rights do not exist. 7. 	The affected employees are not represented by an union. Please contact Justin Perry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, at (614)926-4821, or me for additional information about the closing of the facility. Sincerely, ~ ~~ Chris Hatfield Director, Human Resources (614)926-4845 JobTitle  Number  Accountant  1  Account Planner  1  Accounts Payable  1  Assembler  3  Assoicate Supervisor  2  Compact Operator  1  Consumer Module Processor  3  Controller  1  Coordinator  5  Credit Analyst  1  Credit Manager  1  Customer Service Specialist  4  Director, Customer Service  1  Director, HR  1  Director, Production Scheduling  1  E Commerce Merchant  1  EDI Specialist  1  EVP, Finance CFO  1  EVP, Operation & IT  1  Financial Analyst  1  Fork Lift Operator  17  Group Lead  8  HR Generalist  1  Import Specialist  1  Inventory Coordinator  1  Maintenance Mech.  1  Processor  5  PT Photographer  1  Returns Processor  7  Sr. Finance Manager  1  Sr. Manager of Operations  1  Sr. Manager of Traffic  1  Supervisor  3  System Development Manager  1  Systems Analyst/Report Writer  1  Systems Programmer  1  Traffic Clerk  1  Traffic Coordintor  l  Unloader  2  Web Store Manager  1
