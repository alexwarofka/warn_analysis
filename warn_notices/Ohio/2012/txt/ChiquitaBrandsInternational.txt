(Ohio Local Government and Ohio Department of Job and Family Services) 
2/6/2012 
Pursuant to Section 2102(a)(2) of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, Chiquita Brands International, Inc. hereby provides notice of its intention to close its headquarters facility located at 250 East Fifth Street, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202-5910. The planned closure of the headquarters facility is expected to be permanent in nature and will be completed during 2012. We expect that the job eliminations resulting from the closure will begin on April 6, 2012, and the anticipated schedule for making separations is monthly. Bumping rights do not exist at the facility, as the facility will be closing. Accordingly, we are providing notice to all employees who will incur an employment loss as a result of either not accepting an offer to transfer to Charlotte, North Carolina or having their job eliminated in the relocation. None of the affected employees are represented by a union. A list of job titles and number of affected employees in each job classification will be maintained on site per 20 CFR 639.7(f). The number of affected employees as of the above date is 200, but that number may change given that employees may subsequently decide not to relocate after advising that they would. We are also providing notification of the decision to the employees individually and the Mayor of Cincinnati. If you would like additional information, please call Andrew Ciafardini at (513) 784.8982 or Ed Loyd at (513) 784-8935.
