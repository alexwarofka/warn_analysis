Value City Department Stores, LLC (the "Company") is planning to pennanen_!!y close its store located at 3251 Westerville Rd, Columbus, Ohio 43224. Based on the best available information, we anticipate that the closing will take place on or about April 1, 2008. Given that we will be conducting a liquidation sale prior to the closing date, we expect that our business volume will decline as we approach the closing. Because of the decline, lay offs are anticipated to begin after January 7, 2008. We will keep you up-to-date on these plans and their effect on the lay off schedule. All positions and jobs at the store referenced above will be eliminated. It is anticipated that 141 employees will be affected by the closure of this store. Attached is a list of the affected positions and the number of employees holding each position. Should you have any questions, please contact Kimberly Rhodes, at (614) 418-3696. Sincerely, ~dffildOt-Kimberly RiJ'des Sr. Director, Human Resources Value City Department Stores, LLC Enclosure cc: 	Mayor Michael Coleman City Hall -2nd Floor 90 W.
