Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216 Re: Notification of Layoff-'> Dear Sir: This is to give you formal notification that Eramet Marietta Inc., intends to indefinitely idle its Special Products operations and temporarily idle both its Fl and Fl 2 manganese alloy furnaces all located at 16705 State Route 7, Marietta, Ohio 45750. Economic conditions beyond our control have resulted in a severe reduction in orders that we could not reasonably have foreseen. As a result, an indefinite idling of the special products operation and the temporary idling of Fl for an estimated 60 days, are unavoidable. In addition, thereafter , our #12 furnace will be temporarily idled, pending anticipated market recovery and final funding approval , for an anticipated rebuild for approximately 90 days. The unexpected nature of the reduction in orders has prevented us from giving more notice of the layoffs. It is anticipated that the first layoffs will occur during the first two calendar weeks of March, 2009. The idlings will affect approximately 150 employees , with as many as 110 being on layoff at a time during the period. Because of the uncertainty in the market, we are unable to predict exactly when employees may be recalled. If you need any further information please contact me at 740-376-5914. Very truly yours , John A. Willoughby Director, Human Resources & Public Affairs
