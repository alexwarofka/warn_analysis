RECEIVED IN manisti Q.ue AUGO 5 2011 RAPIDRESPONSEAugust 5, 2011 VIA HAND DELIVERY Margaret Sayles Mayor David C. Peterson Acting Manager -Rapid Response City of Manistique Workforce Development Agency 300 North Maple Street Victor Office Center Manistique, MI 49854 201 N. Washington Sq., 3rd Floor Lansing, Michigan 48913 Dear State and Local Officials: We are giving you notice as ofthis date that effective August 5, 2011 Manistique Papers, Inc. ("Manistique") will be engaging in the first separation of employees leading to the closing of its entire facility located at 453 S. Mackinac Ave., Manistique, Michigan 49854. The facility is expected to be closed in its entirety on August 5, 2011, or any date during the 14-day period thereafter, and there will be a total of 144 employees that will be terminated as a result. Enclosed with this letter is a list of the job titles of positions to be affected and the number of affected employees in each such job classification. We expect the closure of the facility and all te1minations associated with the closing of the facility to be permanent. These employment terminations and closure of the .Manistique facility are being caused by unforeseen business circumstances that occurred while Manistique was in the midst of seeking capital that it reasonably believed it would receive to keep the business operational. Manistique did not provide notice to its employees during this time period because it reasonably believed that such notice would have impeded its ability to obtain the needed capital. Market factors also had an impact. Since January 2011, the cost ofraw material has increased $1,000,000 per month, severely impacting the bottom line. At the same time, soft market conditions resulted ins significant drop in orders. The result of this unanticipated decline in orders created excess inventory and lost revenues. Company management has been working with the Company's bank as well as other potential lenders to seek capital that could keep the business operational. We were recently informed by the bank that they would not provide the necessary working capital needed to continue operations. Our inability to obtain our working capital needs due to the current situation leaves us no choice at this time to close this chapter of Manistique and Michigan history. Although we wish that we could have provided you with more notice prior to taking this action, the unforeseen nature of the bank's decision and the potential that such notice would have on the Company's ability to obtain the needed capital foreclosed that possibility. We have, however, provided you with as much advance notice as was practicable under these circumstances. 453 S Mackinac Ave, Manistique, Michigan 49854 T 906 341 2175 F 906 341 5635 man istiq uepapers.co m manistiQ.ue
