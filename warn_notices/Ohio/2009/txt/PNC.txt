Dear Mr. Valentine: On December 31, 2008, the legal merger of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., ("PNC") and National City Corporation ("National City") was completed. The merger of the two organizations and conversion of our systems results in certain redundancies between National City and PNC operations, which in turn results in the need to restructure certain of our businesses and departments, and the elimination of certain businesses that are inconsistent with our business model going forward. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"), requires that we notify you if either a "plant closing" or a "mass layoff' occurs at any covered site of employment. This letter is to inform you that the elimination of certain business units at our 3232 Newmark Street, Miamisburg, Ohio location constitutes a "plant closing" under WARN -even though PNC will continue to employee well over 1,000 employees at that location. Specifically, we have determined that 74 positions at the 3232 Newmark Street, Miamisburg, Ohio location will be eliminated as a result of "plant closings" at that location. The following information is provided as required under WARN. 1. For purpose ofthis notice only, we have concluded that the relevant affected employment site is 3232 Newmark Street, Miamisburg, Ohio. The name and telephone number of the company official to contact for further information is Brian Ferguson, Vice President, Human Resources (412) 768-8500. 2. The displacements occurring as a result of the merger are expected to be permanent. 3. Unless they obtain employment elsewhere within PNC or with another employer prior to their expected date of displacement, the employment of 74 employees at the Miamisburg, Ohio location is expected to be terminated according to the following schedule: During the 14-day period beginning on September 30, 2009 I employee During the 14-day period beginning on October 2, 2009 6 employees During the 14-day period beginning on November 21, 2009 5 employees During the 14-day period beginning on December 19, 2009 I employee During the 14-day period beginning on December 28, 2009 61 employees The PNC Financial Services Group One PNC Plaza 249 Fifth Avenue Pittsburgh Pennsylvania 15222 2707 www.pnc.com Mr. Valentine July 30, 2009 Page 2 4.
