Shore Drive Menominee, 1\H 49858 Re: Conditional Notice Pursuant to the \'\forker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act Dear j\,fs. Beckhorn: Hostess Brands, Inc. (including its affiliate Interstate Brands C011Joration, "Hostess" or the "Company,,) filed for chapter 11 relief on.January 11, 2012 (the "Filing"). The Company has been actively engaged in discussions with various lenders and potential purchasers regarding Hostess' restructuring both before and after the Filing. Our primary focus is to complete our restructuring of the Company and emerge from chapter 11 as a viable company. However, it is possible that, despite our best efforts, certain events may occur that would require Hostess to sell all or portions of its business and/ or wind down its operations and liquidate. Despite the uncertainty of what may happen, the federal \'Forker Adjustment and Reu11ining Notification Act and certain related State statutes (collectively, "\'lAR.1'\J")generally require employers to provide advance notice in the event of certain covered employment actions. To comply with any \'\f.tUlN obligations Hostess may have, this letter is intended to give you conditional notice that, based upon the best info1mation reasonably available to Hostess at this time, it is possible that one of the following events may occur: ¥ 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, the pursuit of a sale of all or a 
substantial portion of all of Hostess' assets; 
¥ 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, Hostess to stop pursuing the 
resuáucturing of its business; 
¥ 	More than 20% of Hostess' aggregate workforce is laid off after January 11, 2012; ¥ 	Hostess receives an unsatisfact01T resolution of its pending motion before the bankruptcy court regarding certain modifications to its collective bargaining agreements with the Bakers and/ or the Teamsters; ¥ 	There is a strike, walkout, lockout, slowdown or other work stoppage that is likely to have a material 6031 Connection Drive, Irving, TX 75039 -(972} 532-4500 adverse effect on Hostess; or ¥ 	Hostess seeks bankruptcy court approval to commence a sale of property while in bank11.1ptcy which accounts for more than 20% of Hostess' consolidated net sales as reported on Hostess' financial statements for the l:\velve-month period precedingJanuru.y 11, 2012. If one of these events occurs, Hostess may begin the process of permanently ceasing operations, and significantly scaling down operations at its J'vienom.inee i\H -2625 13tl1St located at 2625 13th Street, lvienominec, Jl.,fI 49858.1910, as early as 60 days from the receipt of tlus notice. In such an event, Hostess currently expects substantially all employee separations to occur within 60 days of the receipt of this notice or within a 14-day period thereafter. At the end of tlus process, the entire IVIenomince rvII -2625 13th St would be permanently closed. There will be no bumping rights available to employees in this circumstance. A listing of the job titles of the positions that we would expect to be affected, and the names of the employees m each of those job classifications is attached as Attachment A Some of the affected employees are represented by one of the l:\velve unions listed below.
