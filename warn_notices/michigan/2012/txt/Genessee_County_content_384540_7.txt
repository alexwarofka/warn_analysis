Curtis Chairman, Genessee County Board of Commissioners County Administration Building 1101 Beach Street Flint, J\,Il 48502 Re: 	Conditional Notice Pursuant to the \Vorker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act Dear Ms. Beckhorn: Hostess Brands, Inc. (including its affiliate Interstate Brands Co1poration, "Hostess,, or the "Company") filed for chapter 11 relief on January 11, 2012 (the "Filing"). The Company has been actively engaged in discussions with various lenders and potential purchasers regarding Hostess' restructuring both before and after the Filing. Our pri.tnary focus is to complete our restructuring of the Company and emerge from chapter 11 as a viable company. HO\vever, it is possible that, despite our best efforts, certai.t1 events may occur that would re<]uire Hostess to sell all or portions of its business and/ or wind down its operations and liquidate. Despite the uncertai.t1ty of what may happen, the federal áworker Adjustment and Rctraini.t1g Notification Act and certain related State statutes (collectively, ''\X'ARN")generally require employers to provide advance notice in the event of certai.t1 covered employment actions. To comply with any \XIARN obligations Hostess may have, this letter is intended to give you conditional notice that, based upon the best information reasonably available to Hostess at this time, it is possible that one of the following events may occur: ¥ 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, the pursuit of a sale of all or a 
substantial portion of all of Hostess' assets; 
¥ 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, Hostess to stop pursuing the 
restructuring of its business; 
¥ 	1\fore than 20% of Hostess' aggregate workforce is laid off after January 11, 2012; ¥ 	Hostess receives an unsatisfactory resolution of its pending motion before the bankmptcy court regardi.t1g certain modifications to its collective bargai.tllllg agreements with the Bakers and/ or the Teamsters; 6031 ConnectionDrive, Irving, TX 75039 -(972) 532-4500 ¥ 	There is a strike, walkout, lockout, slowdown or other work stoppage that is likely to have a material adverse effect on Hostess; or ¥ 	Hostess seeks bankruptcy court approval to commence a sale of property while in bankrnptcy which accounts for more than 20% of Hostess' consolidated net sales as reported on Hostess' financial statements for the twelve-month period precedingjanua1y 11, 2012. If one of these events occurs, Hostess may begin the process of permanently ceasing operations, and significantly scaling down operations at its Flint :t\H -3019 \'{1 Pasadena Ave located at 3019 \'{fest Pasadena .Avenue, Flint, l'vfI 48504, as early as 60 days from the receipt of th.is notice. In such an event, Hostess currently expects substantially all employee separations to occur within 60 days of the receipt of this notice or witlun a 14-day period thereafter. At the end of this process, the entire Flint Tull -3019 \'{1 Pasadena Ave would be permanently closed. There will be no bumping rights available to employees in tl1is circumstance. A listing of the job titles of tl1e positions that we would expect to be affected, and the names of the employees 111 each of tl10se job classifications is attached as Attachment A. Some of the affected employees are represented by one of the twelve unions listed below.
