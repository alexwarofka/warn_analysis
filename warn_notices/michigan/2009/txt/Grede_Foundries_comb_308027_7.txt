Carpenter 611 West Ottawa Street, 4<hFloor Kingsford, Ml 49802 Lansing, MI 48933 DearDirector Canfora and Mayor Flaminio; Due to the continued downturn in the economy and the substantial reduction in production at Grede Foundries, Inc. -Iron Mountain Foundry located at 801 S. Carpenter Ave., Kingsford, MI, the Company has laid off a total of 148 employees between December 19, 2008, and May 8, 2009. The positions of employees affected and the number of employees in each position are attached along with the effective date of each layoff. None of these employees are represented by a union and no bumping rights exist. When determining that the layoffs were necessary, we anticipated they would be short term and that we would recall employees within six months. However, based on recent order cancellations and the unexpected duration of the recent economic downturn, we are now unable to predict when the economy will improve and customers will start ordering more castings. As a result, it is now likely these employees may be laid off for six months or more. Therefore, we are providing this notice pursuant to applicable state and federal law. Grcde continues to pursue new work for the plant and intends to recall employees from layoff status as soon as sales volumes permit such return. If you have any questions or concerns about this letter, please feel free to contact me by email at merickson@grede.com or by phone at (906) 779-0204. Sincerely, ~C-Jlsu----.Mark Erickson Human Resources Manager Grede Foundries, Inc. -Iron Mountain Foundry Enc. CASTING INTEGRITY People -Proceea -Pn>duct Grede Foundrie& H.R. 03:06.24 p.m. 05-04-2009 212 Gredl Foundries, Inc. -Iron Mountain Foundry
