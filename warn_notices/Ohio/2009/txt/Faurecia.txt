May 6, 2009 Re: Notice Pursuant to the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Act of 1988 ("WARN") Dear Mr . Turner: In compliance with the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"), this is to notify you that Faurecia Exhaust Systems, Inc.'s facility located at 1255 Archer Drive, Troy, OH 45373, will be experiencing a mass layoff and a closing/shutdown ("Shutdown") of its exhaust assembly operating unit. The date of the permanent layoffs/Shutdown will be May 8, 2009 and will result in the permanent layoff of 168 employees. A list of the affected positions and the number of affected employees in those positions is attached. (Exhibit A). We are giving less than sixty (60) days' notice of the mass layoff/Shutdown due to the unforeseen and unprecedented announcement that Chrysler is closing its assembly plants which accompanied Chrysler's announcement of its bankruptcy filing, the unforeseen and unprecedented decline in our exhaust assembly operating unit business, and the rapidly growing uncertainty regarding our customer base; circumstances which are sudden, dramatic, unexpected, and outside of Faurecia's control. If you have any questions about this mass layoff/Shutdown , please contact me at (937) 418-3407. Sincerely, /}~C~Jo~C.
