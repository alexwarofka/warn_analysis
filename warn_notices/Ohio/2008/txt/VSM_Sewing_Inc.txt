Re: WARN Notice of Facility Consolidation Dear Sir/Madam: This letter provides notice to the State Dislocated Worker Unit, in accordance with the provisions of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, that VSM Sewing Inc. is consolidating operations and intends to close its facility located at 31000 Viking Parkway, Westlake, OH. While the final timetable has not been established, a portion of the facility likely will be shutdown on or about February 1, 2009. The remaining operations will be shut down in stages with expected closure of the entire facility by April 30, 2009. Sales and related departments will be moved to another location in Westlake. At present, there are 119 total employees at the Company's facility in Westlake. Enclosed with this letter is a schedule listing the job titles of the positions affected by the anticipated Westlake closure and the number of affected employees in each job classification, and the anticipated schedule for making separations. The expected date of the first separation will be January 2, 2009, and all employees who will not be retained by VSM are expected to be separated prior to April 30, 2009. VSM expects that the entire site will be closed and the action will be permanent. In addition, bumping rights do not exist for this action. Please feel free to contact me at 615-213-0880 if you have any questions or need additional information. Very truly yours, ~~~ Mike Simmons
