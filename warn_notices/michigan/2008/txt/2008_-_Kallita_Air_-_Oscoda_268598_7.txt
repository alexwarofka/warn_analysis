December 1, 2008 Chong-Anna Canfora Director Rapid Response Section Michigan Department of Labor & Economic Growth 611 W. Ottawa Street, 4th Floor P.O. Box 30004 Lansing, MI 48909 RE: 	Kalitta Air, LLC Notice of Mass Layoff Dear Director Canfora: This notice is being provided to you pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (''WARN''), which requires employers to give official notice to certain government units or officials of a pending mass layoff. Although Kalitta Air may not reach the threshold requirement for the WARN notice since it is still evaluating how many people will be necessary for continuation of its business operations, this will serve as official notice if in fact the threshold numbers as set forth in the WARN act are reached. In addition, Kalitta Air's reduction in employees required for it's operation is the result of unforeseen circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable, thus, Kalitta Air is exempt from the WARN Act 60-Day Notice Requirement. Kalitta Air's corporate headquarters and crewmember base is located at 818 Willow Run Airport, Ypsilanti, Michigan. It also has an aircraft parts and maintenance division at 5063 Skyway Street, Oscoda, Michigan. The Company has determined that there is excess capacity within its business. It has carefully analyzed this situation and its available options and must regretfully report that it has decided to reduce its operations. As a result, we anticipate that we will lay off approximately 245 of our total 1027 employees over the next six (6) months, beginning as early as December 1, 2008. The number of affected employees is anticipated to be as follows: RECEIVED December 1, 2008: Union: 	14 First Officers 17 Flight Engineers DEC08 2UOB January 5, 2009: Union: 56 Captains/First Officers 38 Flight Engineers RAPIDi·H:.0POI\ISE WORKFORCEPROGRAMS 8/8 Willow Run Airport, Ypsilanti, Ml 48198
