Penske maintains an operation located at 36663 Van Born Road, #350, Romulus, Michigan 48174. This letter constitutes written notice to you pursuant to the notice requirements of the WARN Act legislation. Penske, due to a loss of business, will close this operation effective July 28, 2008. That closure will result in the permanent layoff of all of the individuals identified on the attached Exhibits. Lay-offs of these individuals will beoccurring at various times on or prior to the said closing date. At present, Penske employs approximately one hundred seven (107) individuals at its Romulus, Michigan operation. The drivers and warehousing personnel employed by Penske are represented for purposes of collective bargaining by UAW Local Union No. 174. The office and supervisory staff is non-union. I have enclosed a list of these persons. See Exhibit A As you will see on the attached Exhibit A, many of Penske drivers who will be affected by this closing are domiciled at remote locations in Michigan and Ohio. Penske does not have a facility at these locations. Although the drivers will be terminated, there is no physical facility to close. The individuals at the remote locations are dispatched from the Romulus location. The attached lists of individuals also contain the names of persons who, by law, are not entitled to WARN Notification by virtue of the time limitations contained therein. Penske, nevertheless, has supplied these names so that any services which might be available may also beoffered to these individuals. Penske also has contracts with two (2) staffing agencies: (1) Logistics Personnel, LLC ("Logistics") which employees approximately eight (8) persons; and (2) Human Capital Staffing ("HCS) which employs approximately ten ( I 0) persons. Penske will be canceling its service contract with both firms effective July 28, 2008. I have attached a list which also indicates the identity of the affected associates who are employees of these agencies including job titles. See Exhibit B. We deeply regret having to provide you with this notification, however, due to our loss of business at the Romulus, Michigan operation, Penske has no alternative. If you should have any questions regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact me. / Sincer:ly, .( 1 á ( \ ~~//'\~ \ William W. Allport, Esq.
