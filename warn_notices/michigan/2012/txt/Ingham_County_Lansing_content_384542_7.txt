Farrell Chairperson, Eaton County Board of Commissioners Eaton County "1045 Independence Blvd. Charlotte, MI 48813 Re: Conditional Notice Pursuant to the \'(forker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act Dear l\.fs. Beckhorn: Hostess Brands, Inc. (including its affiliate Interstate Brands Corporation, "Hostess" or the "Company") filed for chapter 11 relief on January 11, 2012 (the "Filing"). The Company has been actively engaged in discussions with various lenders and potential purchasers regarding Hostess' restntcturing both before and after the Filing. Our primary focus is to complete our restrucnu·ing of the Company and emerge from chapter 11 as a viable company. However, it is possible that, despite our best efforts, certain events may occur that would require Hostess to sell all or portions of its business and/ or wind down its operations and liquidate. Despite the uncertainty of what may happen, the federal \X1orker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and certain related State statutes (collectively, "\"V.AR..t'J") generally require employers to provide advance notice in the event of certain covered employment actions. To comply with any \\TARN obligations Hostess may have, this letter is intended to give you conditional notice that, based upon the best information reasonably available to Hostess at this time, it is possible that one of the following events may occur: • 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, the pursuit of a sale of all or a 
substantial portion of all of Hostess' assets; 
6031 Connection Drive, Irving, TX 75039 -{972) 532-4500 • 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, I-Iostess to stop pursuing the restructuring of its business; • 	]\fore than 20% of Hostess' aggregate workforce is laid off after January 11, 2012; • 	riostess receives an unsatisfacto1·y resolution of its pending 111otion before the bankiuptcy court regarding certain rnodifications to its collective bargaining agreetnents ,vi.th the Bakers and/ or the Tean1sters; • 	There is a strike, ,valkout, lockout, slo,vdo,vn or other ,vork stoppage that is likely to have a tnatcrial adverse effect on Hostess; or • 	I-Iostess seeks bankruptcy court approval to co1nn1cnce a sale of property ,vhilc in bankruptcy ,vhich accounts for n1ore than 20o/o of I-Iostess' consolidated net sales as reported on Hostess' .financial statetncnts for the t\vclvc-tnonth period preceding January 11, 2012. If one of these events occurs, Hostess n1ay begin the process of pern1anently ceasing operations, and significantly scaling down operations at its Lansing MI -1061 E _Millers Rd located at 1061 East J\lillers Road, Lansing, MI 48911, as early as 60 days frotn the receipt of this notice. In such an event, Hostess currently expects substantially all en1ployee separations to occur ,vi.thin 60 days of the receipt of this notice or ,vithin a 14-day period thereafter. At the end of this process, the entire Lansing Iv.II -1061 E 1v1illers Rd ,vould be per111anently closed. There ,vill be no bun1ping rights available to ernployees in this circun1stance. A listing of the job titles of the positions that ,ve ,vould expect to be affected, and the nan1es of the en1ployccs 111 each of those job classifications is attached as Attachn1ent A. Son1e of the affected c111ployccs arc represented by one of the t\velve unions listed belo,v.
