and Cincinnati, Ohio 
PORTLAND, Ore. -Mar. 17, 2009 -Standard Retirement Services ("The Standard~) 
today announced plans to consolidate its retirement plans administration functions in 
Portland 1 Ore., and Cincinnati, Ohio, to streamline delivery of client administrative 
services. The consolidation will affect ten U.S. locations, including an office in 
Cleveland, Ohio and will take place in phases over the course of the next several 
months. 
'While the transition of these functions will create new positions at The Standard's Portland, Ore., headquarters and in Cincinnati, Ohio, the company doesn't take lightly the effect this has on our colleagues," said Scott Hibbs, president of Standard Retirement Services. The Standard announced it is offering a separation package that includes financial support and employment transition resources. The consolidation does not affect The Standard's sales, customer service and advisory teams nationwide. 'We are absolutely committed to keeping a strong local presence for our customers," said Hibbs. "While The Standard is operating from a position of financial strength, the current economic environment reinforces our commitment to conducting operations at peak efficiency," said Hibbs. "This consolidation will improve the efficiency, consistency and value of the administration services we deliver to our clients.'' Contacts General Media Bob Speltz, (971) 321~3162 Email: bspeltz@standard.com Investor Relations and Financial Media Jeff Hallin, (971) 321-6127 Email: jhallin@standard.com ###
