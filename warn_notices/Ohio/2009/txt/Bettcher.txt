The facility employs approximately 70 hourly and salaried employees and all will be impacted We are working an orderly wind down with our employees and customer base. The Company regrets the loss of employment and impact upon our employees, their families and the community. The Company will work closely with the appropriate state and local agencies to assist employees through this transition period. The Company has also filed for Trade Adjustment Assistance (T AA) application with the. Department of Labor that may provide additional benefits and other services to impacted employees. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 216.916.2257. Regards, Jane E.
