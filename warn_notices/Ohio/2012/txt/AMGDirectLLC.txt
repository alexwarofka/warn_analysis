Box 1618 Columbus, 43216 Dear Ms. Maybriar: This letter is to inform you that AMG Direct LLC, a subsidiary of dELiA *s, Inc., will be closing its Westerville facility and will be contracting out the functions previously performed at the facility to a third party. Accordingly, AMG Direct LLC will be terminating affected employees from their employment with AMG Direct LLC, at the time of closing of the facility which is anticipated to occur on or about April 30, 2012. All affected employees work out of the Company's facility located at 780 Brooksedge Plaza Drive, Westerville, OH 16550. 79 employees in total will be affected. This action is expected to be permanent. There are no bumping rights. If you require further information, you may contact me at 212 590-6207. This notice is being provided as a courtesy since some affected employees may be retained by the third party contractor on substantially similar terms and conditions of employment. As such, by providing this notice AMG Direct LLC is not waiving any right to assert that some or all of these separations do not require sixty (60) days notice under federal law. Sincerely, David Diamond Vice President, Human Resources £Z :L ':/ S-; S3::J,HL
