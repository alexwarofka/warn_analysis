Tilden Township WIA3145 County Rd. PG WORKFORCEPROGRAMSIshpeming, Ml 49849 Subject: Empire Iron Mining Partnership/Tilden Mining Company LC. WARN Notice Dear Ms. Kulju: As a result of a reduction in demand for its pellets, Empire Iron Mining Partnership, which is owned by subsidiaries of Arcelor Mittal Steel USA and Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., and supplies iron ore pellets to those companies for internal consumption and commercial sales, will be required to temporarily idle its operations beginning on or about June 1, 2012 and lasting until on or about October 15, 2012. Operations could resume sooner if unforeseen orders were to materialize for its pellets. It is also possible that the shut down period could be extended if the current demand for its pellets were to soften. We would, of course, advise you of any such change in plans. Due to this temporary idling of Empire's operations, hourly employees at Empire will be laid off on or after June 1, 2012. The number of employees who will be laid off and their job titles are shown on the attached schedule. Because of range wide bumping rights with Tilden Mining Company L.C., employees at each location are affected by reductions in force not only at their own mine but by reductions in force at the other mine. Reductions in force at each location will be made in compliance with the seniority provisions of the September 1, 2008 Basic Labor Agreement and Seniority and Posting Agreement. Benefits for employees laid off will be pursuant to the Basic Labor Agreement, the Supplemental Unemployment Benefits Agreement, and Program of Insurance Benefits applicable to the employees. The United Steeworkers represent hourly employees at Empire Iron Mining Partnership and Tilden Mining Company LC.
