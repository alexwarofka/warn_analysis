Dear Ms. Hennessey: This letter is to update you on the timing of the layoffs as part of the plant closing described in my March 1, 2007, letter. The anticipated date for the layoffs is now expected to be on or within 14 days of May 31 . 2007. This later date Is due to the schedules recently calculated by our customers to complete the parts build-out required for these customers before our operations will end. If you have any questions regarding this, please contact me at 616-850-1592 for further Information. 1{;}~Marty Price
