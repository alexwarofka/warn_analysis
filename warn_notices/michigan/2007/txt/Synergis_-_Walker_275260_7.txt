November 9, 2007 Mayor Rob VerHeulen City of Walker 4243 Remembrance Rd., N.W. Walker, MI 49534 Dear Mr. VerHeulen: This letter is to inform your office and the State of Michigan of the closing and liquidation of Synergis Technologies Group Corporation. Synergis has a facility within the City of Walker, at 2066 Bristol, which will be permanently and completely closed. We do not believe that notice of this is required by the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, but we are providing notice as encouraged by Section 7 of WARN. At the Bristol facility there are approximately 48 employees affected by this closing and liquidation. The expected date for the first separations is within 14 days from today, November 9, 2007. Synergis is also closing its other two facilities, located in the city of Kentwood, Michigan. These plant closings and the liquidation of the business of Synergis is due to the inability of Synergis to obtain adequate financing and new orders to allow the business to survive. We have tried desperately to work with lenders and customers to avoid the need to close. Our situation was made worse by some important existing customers who recently and unexpectedly notified Synergis that the continuation of work by Synergis on their projects would be delayed, creating a severe cash flow shortage. The situation has been volatile these past several days, but we were able to make payroll yesterday and intend to meet payroll obligations as we wind down and conclude our operations. For further infonnation, please contact Human Resources Manager Sharon Bevier, at 616-475.3244. Sincerely~ Cc:  MI Dept. of Career Development Bureau of Workforce Programs s'' Floorá-Victor Office Center 20 I N Washington Square Lansing Ml 48913  NOV1 5 2007  RAPIDHl:SPONSE WORKFORCEPROGRAMS  3155 36/h Street SE Grand Rapids, Michigan 49512 á u.S.A á P. 516.245.4400 ¥ F: 616.475.3204 -www.synergis.us
