Re: Notice of Facility Closing Dear Sir or Madam: Like many other retailers, Office Depot, Inc. is faced with a challenging economic environment. 
After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to close the Distribution Center 
located at 909 Sheldon Road, Plymouth, MI 48170. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Worker Adjustment Retraining Act (WARN), 29 U.S.C. ¤ 210), Office Depot submits official notice that it is permanently closing the operations at this facility. This action will result in a layoff of 115 employees between March 6, 2009, and March 19. 2009. There are no bumping rights. The affected employees are not part of a union. If you have any questions or require further information regarding this matter, please contact: Lynn A. Gross Senior Corporare Attorney -Employment Law Office Depot 6600 N. Military Trail Boca Raton, FL 33496 (561) 438-3773 Lynn,gross@officedepot.com RECEIVED Sincerely, JAN 05 2008á~a~ Lynn A.
