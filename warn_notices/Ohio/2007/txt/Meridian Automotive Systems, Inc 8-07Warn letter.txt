We anticipate that these reductions will cause potential employee separations at this facility as follows: 81 positions on August 19, 2007; 33 positions on September 2, 2007; and 6 positions on September 30, 2007. A list of job titles and the number of employees currently holding affected positions accompanies this letter as Attachment A.
