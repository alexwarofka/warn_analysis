EAS wasengaged in negotiations with a potential buyer that would have enabled EAS to continue operations at this facility. However, on January 29, 2009 those negotiations terminatedwithout reaching a sale agreement. A short time before this decision, at the request of its lender, EAS sought legal counsel to prepare a contingency plan. Subsequent to its retention of counsel, EAS had contacted both its major secured creditor and its major customers in an effort to obtain the financing necessary to continue operations at this facility. Despite these efforts, EAS' inability to obtain the necessary financing to continue operations hasforced it to liquidate its assets and regrettably, order the closing of the facility. #1053:507 vl (135792.2) "EXCELLENCE THROUCiH INNOVATION" This scheduled closing will affect all employees at the facility located at the addresses above. Because there are fewer than 50 employees at Enterprise Custom Products, LLC, ("ECP") we do not believe the provisions of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act, 29 U.S.C. 1201 et seq (the "WARN Act") apply to ECP; however, we have provided this notice out of an abundance of caution and in an effort to provide the affected employees with notice of the closing in a manner c-0ntemplated by the WARN Act. The Plant closures will be permanent. Bumping rights will not be afforded. Employment separations will begin on May 1, 2009 and continue until June 1, 2009. Employees in all job classifications will be affected. We are providing a list of the job classifications with the number of affected employees in each classification. In addition to providing this notice, we have provided notice of the closing to the employee's unions, AW & AW, District Lodge 60, AFL-CIO and I.A.M. Local Lodge 218, through their union representatives, Boby Atanasovski, One Heritage Place, Suite 550, Southgate, MI 48195, and Gray Motoux, c/o Mueller Brass Co., 2199 Lapeer Ave., Port Huron, MI48060. For further information, please contact me at 586.755.3180. Sincerely, ~<;-~ Rich S.
