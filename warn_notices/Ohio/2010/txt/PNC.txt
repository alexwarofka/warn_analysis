Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43219 By overnight express mail Dear Mr. Valentine: This letter is to provide your office with notice of a possible "plant closing" under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN") for PNC's facility located at 4100 West 150th Street, Cleveland, OH, primarily because we are outsourcing our Cleveland Technology Helpdesk operation to a local vendor that will in fact offer employment to many of the displaced employees. As background, on December 31, 2008, the legal merger of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., ("PNC") and National City Corporation ("National City") was completed. The merger of the two organizations and conversion of our systems results in certain redundancies between National City and PNC operations, which in tum results in the need to restructure certain of our businesses and departments, and the elimination of certain businesses that are inconsistent with our business model going forward. Please be advised this possible "plant closing" results in the elimination of a total of 58 positions. 1. For purpose of this notice only, we have concluded that the relevant affected employment site is 4100 West 150th Street, Cleveland, Ohio. The name and telephone number of the company official to contact for further information is Brian Ferguson, Vice President, Human Resources (412) 768-8500. 2. The displacements occurring as a result of the merger are expected to be permanent. 3. Unless they obtain employment elsewhere within PNC or with another employer prior to their expected date of displacement, the employment of the 58 employees at the Cleveland, Ohio location is expected to be terminated according to the following schedule: 4. The following is a list of the affected job titles and the number of employees in each of those job titles at the affected location: During the 14-day period beginning on March 30, 2010 57 employees During the 14-day period beginning on April 30, 2010 1 employee Member of The PNC Financial Services Group Mr. Valentine January 27, 2010 Page2 Affected Job Title  Number of Emwovees  COMMAND CENTER SPECIALIST I  19  COMMAND CENTER SPECIALIST II  9  COMMAND CENTER TEAM LEAD  6  INFRASTRUCTURE SUPERVISOR  2  TECH SUPPORT SPECIALIST I  13  TECH SUPPORT SPECIALIST II  5  TECH SUPPORT SPECIALIST, SENIOR  3  SENIOR TRUST SYSTEMS SPECIALIST  1  5. The affected employees are not represented by a union. 6. The employees are not able to exercise bumping rights. 7. All affected employees have already been notified that their current position is expected to be eliminated. Even after these displacements, PNC will continue to employ over 1,000 employees at this facility. Please contact me if you have any questions about the information in this letter. Sincerely yours, Brian Ferguson Vice President, Human Resources Date Received  January 29, 2010  Company Name  PNC Bank  Location (City/County)  Cleveland (Cuyahoga)  Number of Affected Workers  58  Layoff Dates  3/30/10 (majority to be laid oft); 4/30/10 (1 worker)  Phone Number  (412) 768-8500  Union Affiliation  None  WARN Identification No.  003-09-085
