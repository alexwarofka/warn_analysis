Box 1618 Columbus, Ohio 43216-1618 Dear Sir or Madam, This letter is to inform you of NCR Corporation's intent to permanently close its Dayton, Ohio Headquarters facllity located at 1700 South Patterson Boulevard beginning September 30, 2009 with various termination dates through the fourth quarter of 2010. Approximately 598 employees working at the NCR Dayton facility will incur an employment loss as a result of these actions. The job titles and number of affected employees are attached. Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act), each affected employee will receive written notification of his or her termination date at least 60 days in advance of that date. Affected employees do not have bumping rights. There are no represented employees at the Dayton, Ohio Headquarters facility. To help those affected by the Headquarters closure, NCR will offer a comprehensive severance package and outplacement services to all employees who continue working until their designated termination dates. The outplacement program involves change management and career counseling and a series of formal re-employment seminars prior to the employees' last day of work. The outplacement program will provide affected employees with information regarding job opportunities and will work with other companies to attempt to place these individuals. Information regarding the decision to relocate the Dayton Headquarters operations to the State of Georgia was originally communicated on June 21 2009 and affected employees will begin receiving official notifications effective today, July 29, 2009. If you require further information, please contact NCR's Director of the HR Knowledge Center, Lynn Gaughan, at (937)445-1022 or Lynn.Gaughan@NCR.com. Si//rely,6.t..C,/J,1.~ ,b;cAl4/\.._ ____ ,, Connie Jofns,9 Vice Prest t -Human Resources Operations NCR Corporation Attachment ·rn.1~1...1"\1...orporauon 10:Attached Image (16147285938) 09:30 07/29/09GMT-04 Pg 03-04 ·m:Nl;K c;orporatlon To:Attached Image (16147285938) 09:30 07/29/09GMT -04 Pg 04-04 JobTltle  9l30IZ009  """'""' 2009  NOV'""°"' 2009  """""'""2009  ' January 2010  F•""""Y 2010  M.>rcl12010  Ap,112010  May2010  JU!tt 2010  ~2010  Q4 2010  \:Kano Total  Ptoiec!Ma......,,..  1  1  PrOtaCt/?ruora,n Mt:!OaOer  1  4  1  1  2  9  PS Coosullant  1  6  3  2  12  PS Ons Cons  1  1  2  PS oos C0osuttao(  1  t  PS $eNOrPartMf  1  1  PSSr~  1  1  3  6  PS SlalfConsultant  1  1  3  2  3  10  Pw/ic Relabon$ """"  1  1  2  Quaitv ""'"'nt  1  ,  1  3  QualitvOeve!O= 1-nn  1  1  Real Estate Manaaer  1  1  Sales  ""'"""""Analvst  2  12  6  2  1  - __ 1 __ ,_  24  Sales  -n11:~1tnf"l:tMor  1  1  Sale& •""""""''""""'  1  1  $ales C  los $to0l Tl.  1  1  2  Sales Raoomna AnalvSl  1  1  2  """'"""Msnaoer  1  1  S&cwftyOfflc,l(  2  5  7  Ser, Oeslan c-JltJUnr  1  1  2  Sel\llce 0eS!(JtlCooault  1  1  1  2  ')  1  Senke DesianDirector  1  1  Sllltl S""""""""·SecutitY  1  3  ~  Sl$/Channe!Dev Soec  1  1  SoftwareEno,,eer  6  3  5  14  Software1SvsEnoArnv.:  1  16  3  1  20  41  sEooSrAnl Soktiol'!Enotneer  6  4  14  1  24 1  SolutionsMktaSoec  2  1  4  1  8  Sr S!l'at = P""""' Consult  1  1  SI~ ConsutiMI  3  1  1  6  ~Maliaaer  1  1  @<""""":ms Proa Mar  1  1  s er TaxMBlysl  5  1  1  2  1  1 9  Tax!wector  1  1  Tax Manaoer  1  1  2  1  6  Ted1nical "'""""' SMC  1  2  3  TastEnNirl<>Al'  2  2  TreaW!YAnal\'St  1  1  3  6  Gl'iilld Total  18  34  20  183  28  12  78  34  16  16<1  6  9  an
