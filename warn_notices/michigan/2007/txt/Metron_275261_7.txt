Washington Square Lansing, Ml 48913 Re: Facility Closing Notice Dear Ms. Hennessey: We regret to infonn you that Metron of Bloomingdale is closing its facility at 42235 County Road 390, Bloomingdale, Michigan. The closing of this facility is expected to be permanent, and the entire facility will be closed. The number of employees affected by the closing of this facility is 90. The expected date of the first employment terminations resulting from the closure is November 23, 2007, or within 14 days thereafter. We expect that all employees will be terminated on or before December 9, 2007. There are no bumping rights, but we intend to work with area job placement organizations to help employees find other positions. This notice is provided under Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification ("WARN") Act. Greater advance notice was not given because of the very severe and unforeseeable business circumstances that made this closure necessary. For many months, Metron and its staff members have made an enormous commitment of time, effort and financial resources in the genuine hope that this facility could survive difficult financial and regulatory circumstances. But a state licensing survey in last several days produced an extremely difficult adverse outcome that was neither foreseen nor foreseeable. These circumstances have made it impossible for the nursing home to continue to operate in a manner that v;ould fulfill regulatory obligations and meet its basic financial responsibilities. If you have any questions regarding this, please contact Jim Osborn at 616-975-5311 or Melissa Sluss at 616-975-5347. Sincerely,  )r1uOJ'lU nuu-rtu1 /fl'\[  Melanie Norman  RECEIVED  Metron of Bloomingdale  NOV1 B 2007  RAPIDRESPONSE WORKFORCEPROGRAMS
