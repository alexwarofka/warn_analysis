This is but a small number of individuals who work at the Mason facility, but we are notifying you to insure that we are in compliance with all applicable laws related to mass layoffs and terminations. Fortunately, all of the positions that will be eliminated will be outsourced to a local third-party vendor who services the Cincinnati market. We expect our vendor to offer the impacted employees at-will employment immediately following their lay-off from Cintas. We also expect our vendor to offer the impacted employees a rate of pay and a benefit package that is commensurate with what they currently receive from Cintas. If you would like further information about this reduction in force, please feel free to contact me at 513-701-1382. Robin Everhart Chief Compliance Officer & VP of Government Affairs cc: City of Mason -Mayor Don Prince Cintas Corporation 6800 Cintas Blvd. P.O.
