Defiance Street, Archbold, Ohio 43502 will significantly reduce manufacturing operations at that facility on or about July 15, 2009, resulting in a mass layoff of approximately 75 employees. Because of the economic downturn and unexpected loss of business, the Archbold facility will close on or about September 30, 2009, resulting in permanent job loss for the remaining employees who are not selected for the July layoff. The total number of employees affected is approximately 146. This job loss is expected to be permanent. A list of affected positions is enclosed. A longer advance notice was not possible to due to the unforeseen loss of business from Chrysler, General Motors, and Ford, and because Nobel was a faltering company that believed further advance notice would preclude its ability to obtain business. Affected employees do not have bumping rights. Some of the affected employees are represented by the UAW Local No. 86, President Kris Neuenschwander, 1691 Woodlands Drive, Maumee, Ohio 43537. If you need further information, please contact me at 419.439.0843. Director of North American Operations ~Automotive Orhan Holding
