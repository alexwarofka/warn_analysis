Dear Mr. Palmer: Subject: Notice of Plant Closing Pursuant to the W.A.R.N. Act Pursuant to the "Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act" (W.A.R.N.), you are hereby notified 
of a planned employment loss in the form of a plant closing as defined by the W.A.R.N. Act at 
the General Motors Powertrain (GMPT) Saginaw Malleable Iron Plant located at 77 West Center 
Street, Saginaw, Michigan. The plant closing date is currently planned to take effect on June 1, 
2007. Some employees, particularly the temporary employees, may be released before June 1, 
2007. The plant closing will result in the retirement, permanent layoff, placement of employees 
into a contractual status known as a JOBS Bank which provides regular wages for a minimum of 
40 hours per week, and/or placement of employees at other General Motors' facilities, of up to 
86 regular employees and 28 temporary employees represented by the UAW International 
Union, Ron Gettelfinger, President, 8000 East Jefferson Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48214. The 
Saginaw Malleable Iron Plant has also been operating with fifteen (15) hourly employees 
borrowed from GMPT Saginaw Metal Casting Operations. These employees will be returned to 
their home plant for job placement. In addition to the hourly employees, 21 salaried employees 
are currently employed at the closing plant. Of these, nine employees will voluntarily retire 
when the plant closes. Salaried employees have no bumping rights. GM expects to be able to 
find employment at other GM locations for most of the salaried employees affected by the plant 
closing. 
Contractors are currently providing the services of 112 contract employees at the plant. The 
services of these non-GM contract house employees will be terminated upon the plant's closing 
or earlier. 
Attached hereto, are the job titles of positions and the number of affected employees in each job 
classification.
