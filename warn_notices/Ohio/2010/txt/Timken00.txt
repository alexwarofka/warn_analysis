Box 1618 Columbus, Ohio 43216-1618 Dear Sir or Madam: The purpose of this letter is to notify you regarding the layoff of certain employees of The Timken Company ("Company") attributable to a cessation of manufacturing activity at the Company's Gambrinus Bearing Plant, located at 2401 Gambrinus Road, S.W., Canton, Ohio 44706. We note that the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Act of 1988, 29 U.S.C. ¤2101 et seq. ("WARN") in some instances requires and in other instances encourages the provision of notice to affected employees and specified governmental entities of a pending "plant closing," and this notice is being provided in that spirit. More than five years ago, we announced that our Canton, Ohio, bearing operations were facing competitive challenges and were likely heading for a closure that could have affected more than 1,000 people. Since beginning the process, we experienced several years of high demand, which slowed the pace of consolidation, and during this time, most of the associates affected were able to retire or transfer into other Timken jobs. The global recession in 2009 worsened the situation, with even lower demand for the bearings produced in Canton. As a result, we ceased production at the Gambrinus Bearing Plant, located at 2401 Gambrinus Road, S.W., Canton, Ohio 44706, in September 2009, uncertain as to the duration. Although, we still have both bearing component and steel operations in Canton, it now appears unlikely that Timken will resume production at the Gambrinus Bearing Plant. While the vast majority of associates have transferred or retired, this recent decision currently affects 57 associates. However, the operative associates do have recall rights, and as the economy recovers and our customer demand increases, these associates may have an opportunity to regain Timken employment elsewhere in Canton. In fact, we've recalled nearly all of our laid-off steel operative associates to meet current demand, and the bearing plant associates have recall rights to steel if the steel associates are all back to work. As the attached Tables indicate, some individuals have already been laid off in a series of reductions. While those layoffs were originally expected to be of short duration, it now appears that some may continue in excess of 6 months. The total number of individuals who have been laid off due to the cessation of manufacturing is less than 50. Additional layoffs are expected in the future, per the attached Schedules. To the extent that the above actions constitute a covered event under WARN, this letter is intended to fulfill any requirements imposed by the Act. By providing this information, however, the Company does not concede that the Act applies or that notice is otherwise required. Page 2 March 31, 2010 The Timken Company Of the employees affected, 33 are represented by the United Steelworkers of America, AFL.CIO Local Union No. 1123. The job titles, number of affected employees, and layoff dates of represented workers already laid off is attached at Table A. The president of the local union is Joseph Hoagland, 1234 Harrison Avenue, S.W., Canton, Ohio 44706. With regard to these union members, affected employees were determined by collectively bargained guidelines as to job loss, including seniority, layoffs, retrogression, and "bumping rights." While laid off, the employees listed in Table A have received a Security Payment, Supplemental Unemployment Benefits, and/or other wage replacements as outlined by the collective bargaining agreement between the parties. Certain additional represented employees are expected to experience layoffs in the future as a result of the cessation of manufacturing at the Gambrinus Bearing Plant. The employees, the job titles, and projected layoff dates are provided at Table B. Although it is not anticipated at this time that the Gambrinus Bearing Plant will resume manufacturing operations, each of the affected represented employees has a contractual recall right to other of the Company's sites of employment or operating units within other sites of employment. In this sense, the layoffs are expected to be temporary in nature. Thirteen of the affected employees are not represented by a union. Their job titles, number of affected employees, and layoff dates are provided in attached Table C. These salaried employees whose employment was involuntarily terminated received severance benefits, if otherwise eligible, based upon their length of service with the Company. The minimum severance received by salaried employees was nine weeks. Certain additional salaried employees are expected to be laid off in the future. Their job titles, the number of affected employees, and projected layoff dates are provided at attached Table D. Layoffs of these salaried employees are expected to be permanent. Notices are also being sent to the President of the local union, the chief elected official of Canton, Ohio, and salaried employees directly. This notice is based upon the best information that the Company has available to it at this time. If there are changes to the Company's plans or in the timing of future layoffs, you will be notified as soon as possible.
