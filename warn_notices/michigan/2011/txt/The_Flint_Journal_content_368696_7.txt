Dear Stephanie Beckhorn, We're contacting you today to inform you about the launch of two new companies that will house all our operations from this point forward in Michigan and to deliver information as required by federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"). One new company, the MLive Media Group, will encompass all content, sales, and marketing operations for all our digital and print properties in Michigan. Another new company, Advance Central Services -also based in Michigan -will be a shared services company, the engine providing all production, distribution, purchasing, accounting, human resources, and other critical support functions for the MLive Media Group. These two companies -along with Advance Digital, who will continue to serve as the innovation engine behind the growth and development of an array of our products and services -will work hand-in-hand to deliver on the promise of our business in Michigan: to serve communities around the state with the highest quality news and information of the moment. We will collaborate with the communities we serve, the employees who work with us, the advertisers we partner with, and the users and readers who count on the news and information we provide. pJ:´JOURNAL 
[WTOUCH [IIIDEPTH lm]VOLVED Our future will be grounded in the principles that made us who we are today, shaped by what we'll learn together, and driven by a desire to do what's right for our readers, our employees, our advertisers, and the communities of Michigan we serve -and today is just the beginning. Many employees will have a place in the MLive Media Group or Advance Central Services. However, that will not be the case for every employee, so layoff notices are being sent to those not initially selected. Throughout this process we'll treat all our employees with the professionalism and respect they deserve. We are providing this notice to satisfy the requirements of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"). The Flint Journal, located at 200 East First St, Flint, Michigan, will be permanently closing operations at its facilities located at 200 East First St., Flint and will be moving its production operations to Valley Publishing. The closing and last day of employment for 91 out of the 142 employees will be on January 2, 2012. Four of the ninety-one employees who will be laid off are represented by a union and no employees have bumping rights. Listed below are the job titles and number of employees in each title whose employment will be terminated. Job Title  Em pis in Each Title  Account Executive I  4  Account Executive Senior  3  Acct Executive, Experienced  1  Administrator I  7  Administrator II  4  Administrator, Experienced  2  Advertising Sales Manager  2  Building Technician, Sr.  1  Cashier  1  Content Specialist Experienced  1  Customer Support Rep I  9  District Assistant  7  pJ:´JOURNAL
