June 3, 2009 Dear Ms. Canfora, Please see the attached Legal Notice (WARN). There is currently the potential of layoffs totaling approximately 120 personnel at our East Tawas, Michigan facility due our company's descouring by General Motors. We are however actively pursuing plans that could reduce the required number of layoffs through the internal transfer of outsourced business, the transfer of business from our parent company, the awarding of takeover business and the awarding of new business. Recently we have had success in expanding our customer base, including new business awards from Ford, BMWand Newman Technologies for our East Tawas, Michigan facility. While the above plans do look promising at this time, we cannot guarantee that they will have the desired long term effect. If you would like to discuss our situation any further, please feel free to contact me at (989) 362-4419, extension #144. Sincerely, ~.JZ-4, Paul K Karoly VP of Human Resources RECEIVED Plastic Trim International, Inc. JUN 04 2009 RAPIDRESPONSE WORKFORCEPROGRAMS PKK/pk/6-3-09 Pl.ASTICTRIM INTERNATIONAL,INC. 935AULERICH ROADá EAsTTAWAS.
