As a result, most of the employees at the Port Huron facility will terminate from their employment with Henkel. We anticipate that employment terminations will be permanent and that they will commence during a 14-day period beginning on April 22, 2011. We also expect that the entire facility will be closed. These separations will take place in phases. At this time, eight (8) employees have volunteered to terminate their employment during the 14-day period commencing on April 22, 2011. A list of the job titles, number of employees and termination periods of the employees in this phase is enclosed with this letter. In addition to those employees, we anticipate that there will be further employment terminations more than 60 days from now. Changing business needs do not allow us to predict exactly when those later separations will occur, but we will provide you further information when we get it. This announcement and the above timetable are based on the best information currently available. However, various factors may still affect these plans and the timing of employee separations. You will be informed of any changes as additional information becomes available. The Teamsters Local Union No. 33 7 represents the hourly production, shipping and maintenance employees at this location. The chief elected officer of that union is Larry Brennan, President, 2801 Trumbull A venue, Detroit, Michigan 48216. Only very limited bumping rights exist for the unionized employees at the facility. These are described in a Supplemental and Closing Agreement between Henkel and the Union . . -á ... To the extent that the above actions constitute a covered event under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any other notice law, this letter is intended to Henkel Corporation  Phone:  810á984-5581  Email Address  1600 Washington Avenue  Fax:  810á984-3135  www.henkelna.com  Port Huron, Michigan, 48060  8 Excellence is our Passion fulfill any requirements imposed under such laws.
