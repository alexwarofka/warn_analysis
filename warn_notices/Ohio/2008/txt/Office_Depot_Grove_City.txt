After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to close the facility located at 3425 Urbancrest Industrial, Grove City, OH 43123. Pursuant to the requirements of the Worker Adjustment Retraining Act (WARN), 29 U.S.C. ¤ 2101, et seq., Office Depot submits official notice that it is permanently closing the operations at this facility. This action will result in a layoff of 104 employees between February 9, 2009, and February 22, 2009. There are no bumping rights. The affected employees are not part of a union. If you have any questions or require further information regarding this matter, please contact: Lynn A. Gross Senior Corporate Attorney -Employment Law Office Depot 6600 N. Military Trail Boca Raton, FL 33496 (561) 438-3773 Lynn.gross@officedepot.com ~:()JiirJP Lynn A. Gross
