Dear Ms. Jones-Kelley: I regret to inform you that Michelin North America will permanently discontinue production operations and close its Mogadore plant located at 3360, Mogadore, OH 44260 as of November 1, 2007. Unfortunately, this action will result in terminating the employment of seventy-two (72) people -fifty.seven (57) wage employees and fifteen (15) salaried employees. Employment terminations are planned in reverse order of seniority from date of hire and no bumping rights exist. The first terminations will begin on July 8, 2007. Terminations will continue through to November 1, 2007. In light of this difficult decision, Michelin is offering all affected employees the following assistance (assuming this applies): ¥ 	Outplacement services through a company specializing in these types of services that will be determined at a later date; ¥ 	Severance pay based on length of service; ¥ 	Services of Michelin's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to employees and their families; and, ¥ 	Michelin representatives on-site to help resolve any questions or concerns regarding employee benefits package. I truly regret that Michelin has found it necessary to close this facility. Your support and the support of the State of Ohio for the Company are very much appreciated. If you have questions about this information or need additional assistance, please contact me at (330) 733.0386 or Davis Jackson, Facility Personnel Manager at (205) 391-6258. Sincerely,
