Dear Ms. Cantara: This notice is being provided to you by the Observer & Eccentric and Hometown papers under and pursuant to the federal WARN Act. The Observer & Eccentric and Hometown papers have created a new business model which ceases publication of the Birmingham, West Bloomfield, Troy and Rochester editions of the Eccentric. In addition, Southfield will become part of a multi-community newspaper published on Sunday only. This is business plan will take effect on May 301h 2009. We anticipate this will 
result in approximately 44 employees being laid off. Employees will be paid 
through June 111h and then receive severance, where applicable. 
Several of these employees are represented by a labor organization. I have met with and notified representatives of Local 13N and Local 22 to inform them of these decisions. You may contact me directly with any questions. Sincerely 1~1}.~ Kristi B. Bowden
