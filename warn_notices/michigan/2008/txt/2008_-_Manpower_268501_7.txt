Manpower Inc. expects that its employees' assignments will be ended during a 14-day period commencing on December 31, 2008. The termination of assignments is not the result of any action taken by Manpower Inc., but rather is the result of Haworth lncorporated's planned closing of the facility and its decision to end the assignments. Haworth lncorporated's decision. which was a business circumstance unforeseeable to Manpower Inc., prevented notice from being provided at an earlier date. It is presently anticipated that the ending of assignments will be permanent and that approximately [68] Manpower temporary employees will be affected. No bumping rights exist in connection with this action and the Manpower temporary employees do not have union representation. Affected temporary employees' employment with Manpower will not automatically terminate as a result of Haworth lncorporated's decision to end Manpower assignments at this facility; such employees will be considered by Manpower for other placements. Additional information concerning this matter, including the job titles and positions to be affected may be obtained by contacting: Jean Thompson Haworth On-Site Rep. River St., Allegan, Ml RECEIVED
