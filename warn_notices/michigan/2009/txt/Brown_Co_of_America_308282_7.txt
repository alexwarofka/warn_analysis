Re: Tire Brown Company of America, LLC; Notice of Permanent Layoffs Dear Director Canfora: The Brown Company of America, LLC's production facility at 1403 E. 12-Mile Road, Madison Heights, Ml 48071, will permanently layoff approximately eight (8) employees on November 6, 2009. No bumping rights exist with respect to these employees; The Brown Company of America, LLC is non-union. While we don't believe that we are legally required to provide this notice, we are voluntarily providing this information in order to keep you informed of the ongoing situation. These permanent layoffs are the result of Brown's failure to obtain additional capital and business over the last few months. Brown has been actively seeking capital and business that would have been sufficient, if obtained, to avoid these permanent layoffs. Brown could not give WARN notice earlier because to do so would have compromised Brown's ability to obtain the capital and business it was seeking. When Brown's efforts to obtain additional capital and business failed, it had little choice but to agree to sell the Company to Matcor. The Brown Company has prepared, and will make available upon request, a listing of the job titles and positions to be affected and the number of affected employees in each position. If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact me at ( 616) 527-4050. Sincerely, 3010967 N(·'.
