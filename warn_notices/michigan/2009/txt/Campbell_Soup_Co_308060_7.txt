Ottawa Street Lansing, Ml 48933 RE: Joseph CambeU Company -MarshaU, Michigan Dear Mr. Smith and Ms. Canfora: Josepb Campbell Company, a subsidiary of Campbell Soup Company, has operated a manufacturing facility at 210 West Oliver Drive, in the City of Marshall, since it was acquired in 1982. While it has manufactured a number of Campbell's products over time, since 2002, it has served as one of the primary manufacturing sites for Campbel/ 's Soup at Hand products. Demand for Soup at Hand has declined over the past few years, causing the Company to explore ways in which it could optimize its manufacturing network. After a comprehensive review, the Company decided to transition the Marshall facility to manufacture only seasonally rather than all year-round. On or around January 30, 20 l O(or, at the earliest, some time within the 14-day period beginning January 29, 20 IOand ending February 12, 2010), manufacturing operations at the plant will cease and approximately 80 employees -representing most of the plant's hourly and salaried workforce will be severed from the Company. Approximately 12 employees will be retained to work at the facility all year. At this time, it is not anticipated that the plant will be used in the near future as a year-round manufacturing facility. However, as a seasonal facility, it is anticipated that manufacturing operations at the plant will resume in the late spring or early summer of2010 for next year's "soup season." In advance of next year's soup season (approximately June 2010), the Company will begin preparing to resume manufacturing operations at the plant. Most of the former Marshall hourly employees will be invited to return to the plant as seasonal employees for another season (roughly through January of the next year). Honorable Bruce R. Smith Chong-Anna Canfora, Director November 11, 2009 Page 2 Please allow this letter to serve as the notice required under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"), 29 U.S.C. ¤¤ 2101 et seq. I have been designated at the Company's contact person with regard to this announcement. You may reach me at the address and telephone number set forth above. Angela Cuvelier
