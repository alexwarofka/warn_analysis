AIR CARGO Rob Miller Vice President, Employee Relations January 5, 20 I 0 Captain John Prater President Air Line Pilots Association, lnt'I 1625 Massachusetts Ave NW Washington, DC 20036 Captain Pat Walsh ASTAR MEC Chairman 1435 Rombach Ave. Suite 4 Wilmington, OH 45177 Re: 	Notification Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C. ¤¤210 I et seq.) Dear Captains Prater and Walsh: ASTAR Air Cargo, Inc. ("ASTAR" or the "Company") will be conducting a permanent reduction in force affecting some of its pilot employees, who are domiciled at 236 Wendel Ford Boulevard, Erlanger, Kentucky 41018. Although AST AR does not believe that notice of these furloughs is required under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"), 29 U.S.C. ¤¤210 I et seq., AST AR is providing such notice out of an abundance of caution. As you know, our primary customer, OHL, has significantly reduced its airlift requirements and AST AR has been forced to significantly reduce its flying capacity. As a result, on March 6, 20 I 0, AST AR will begin a series of furloughs that will reduce its total pilot workforce of 456 as of January 5, 20 I 0, to approximately 153 pilots. On March 6, 20 I 0, AST AR will furlough all pilots below No. 261 on the seniority list, or a total of 195 pilots. The number and timing of these furloughs is not anticipated to change. On or about April 4, 20 I 0, AST AR anticipates furloughing all pilots below No. 238 on the seniority list, or an additional 23 pilots. The number or timing of these furloughs may change slightly based on training requirements for pilots that will not be furloughed. On or about May 5, 20 I 0, AST AR anticipates furloughing all pilots below No. 227 on the seniority list, or an additional 11 pilots. This number and timing of these furloughs may also change slightly based on training requirements. On or about June I, AST AR Air Cargo ¥ 7310 Turfway Road. Suite 400, Florence. KY 410-42 ¥ Phone: (859) 980-1790 ¥ Fax: (866) 790-73 14 Rob Miller Vice President, Employee Relations 20 I 0, AST AR anticipates furloughing all pilots below No. 178 on the seniority list, plus 19 pilots who previously elected to be placed on voluntary furlough status, or an additional 68 pilots. This number and timing of these furloughs may also change slightly based on training requirements. On or about July I, 20 I 0, AST AR anticipates furloughing approximately six additional pilots who have higher seniority positions, but who previously elected to be placed on voluntary furlough status. Attached to this notice as Exhibit A are the names of affected employees, their job titles and projected furlough dates. For further information, please contact me at 859-980-1790. Very truly yours, Rob Miller Vice President, Employee Relations ASTAR.
