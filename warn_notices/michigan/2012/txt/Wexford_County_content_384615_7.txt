Division St Cadillac, i\U 49601 Re: 	Conditional Notice Pursuant to the \'{forker .Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act Dear }.,fs. Beckhorn: Hostess Brands, Inc. (including its affiliate Interstate Brands Corporation, "Hostess" or the "Company") filed for chapter á1t relief on January 11, 2012 (the "Filing"). The Company has been actively engaged in discussions with various lenders and potential purchasers regarding Hostess' restructuring both before and after the Filing. Our primary focus is to complete our restmcturing of the Company and emerge from chapter 11 as a viable com.pany. However, it is possible that, despite our best efforts, certain events may occur that would require Hostess to sell all or portions of its business and/ or wind down its operations and liguidate. Despite the uncertainty of what may happen, the federal \\forker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and certain related State statutes (collectively,<"\,, ARN") generally require employers to provide advance notice in the event of certain covered employment actions. To comply with any \\TAR.t"\Jobligations Hostess ma}' have, this letter is intended to give you conditional notice that, based upon the best information reasonably available to Hostess at this time, it is possible that one of the following events may occur: ¥ 	The board of dircctms authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, the pursuit of a sale of all or a 
substantial portion of all of Hostess' assets; 
¥ 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, Hostess to stop pursuing the 
rest11.1ch1ringof its business; 
¥ 	1\fore than 20% of Hostess' aggregate workforce is laid off after January 11, 2012; ¥ 	Hostess receives an unsatisfacto1T resolution of its pending motion before the bankruptcy court regarding certain modifications to its collective bargaining agreements with the Bakers and/or the Teamsters; ¥ 	There is a strike, walkout, lockout, slowdown or other work stoppage that is likely to have a material 6031 Connection Drive, Irving, TX 75039 -(972) 532-4500 adverse effect on Hostess; or ¥ 	Hostess seeks bankruptcy court approval to commence a sale of property while in bankruptcy which accounts for more than 20% of Hostess' consolidated net sales as reported on Hostess' financial statements for the twelve-month period preceding January 11, 2012. If one of these events occurs, Hostess may begin the process of permanently ceasing operations, and significantly scaling down operations at its Cadillac 1\H -838 N lviitchell located at 838 North wiitchell, Cadillac, MI 49601, as early as 60 days from the receipt of this notice. In such an event, Hostess currently expects substantially all employee separations to occur within 60 days of the receipt of this notice or witl1in a 14-day period thereafter. At the end of this process, the entire Cadillac MI -838 N 1\fachell would be pe11nanently dosed. There will be no bumping rights available to employees in this circumstance. A listing of the job titles of tl1e positions that we would expect to be affected, and the names of tl1e employees m each of those job classifications is attached as Attachment .A. Some of the affected employees are represented by one of the twelve unions listed below.
