Dear Ms. Vance: Titis letter is to notifj, you that The Monroe Publishing Company, owner and publisher of The Monroe Evening News, after much consideration and research, has decided to outsource the printing of our newspaper to another company based in Michigan. This will greatly reduce the number of employees at our Press and Distribution Center, located at 1040 Huber Drive, Monroe, MI 48162. This facility houses our p1inting presses, newspaper inserting machine and other printing-related equipment. All printing and inserting of all of the products currently produced there, including the daily newspaper, willbe outsourced. The facility will remain in use as the distribution point for the newspaper and other publications. This change will effectively eliminate all of the full-time positions and many of the part-time positions currently at that facility. This will affect nine (9) full-time positions, which includes our plant manager, the press foreman, five (5) press operators and one distribution supervisor, and approximately twenty-five (25) part-time positions comprised mainly of newspaper inserters. These are all non-union jobs, and no bumping rights are available. The physical building willcontinue to be utilized as a distribution point for our products, until said building can be sold. At that time we willcontinue to operate another facility somewhere in Monroe County. A small number of part-time employees, bctween 8 and 10, will be retained to coordinate the distribution of our products. At this time, we anticipate that outsourcing our printing will begin on or about December 19, 2011. If you have any questions regarding this notification, please contact me for fiu1her information. din 	ely, j" ~-.. tl~v , ,--:: ,. ,,-~i e__ ~~/Uj~Lor~ru!1cppler-Moyer /-{" --CJ President and Publisher LPM/rr
