Box 1618 Columbus, Ohio 43216-1618 Re: Notice of Manufacturing Facility Mass Layoff This letter is to inform you that White Electronic Designs Corporation ("WEDC") plans to discontinue operations of its manufacturing facility known as White Electronic Designs-Interface Electronics Division (legal name IDS Acquisition Corp), located at 539 Industrial Mile Road, Columbus, Ohio 43228 (the "Site"). This plan has now been finalized and will result in the permanent discontinuation of operations at Interface Electronics Division and in turn, permanently laying off/terminating employment of all WEDC employees at the facility. This notice is provided in the spirit of, and in compliance with as applicable, the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act (Public Law No. 100-379), which in some instances requires and in other instances encourages the provision of notice to affected employees and specified governmental entities of a pending facility shutdown. The facility will be permanently laying-off all 56 employees. The layoffs will be conducted in three (3) phases (see attached schedule for dates and positions affected). The first date of permanent layoffs is scheduled to occur on April 24, 2009; the second date on May 22, 2009; and the final date for the last group of terminations and in which the facility is scheduled to permanently close will be June 19, 2009. As stated in 20 C.F.R. ¤639.7(f), we will maintain all other information listed in 20 C.F.R. ¤639(e) for inspection. All affected employees have received notification of the plan and severance arrangements that may be available. As a non-union facility, there are no union representatives to notify of the mass layoff. Furthermore, pursuant to company policies, transfer and/or "bumping rights" do not apply in this case. For further information you may contact Kristy A. Postal, Human Resources Manager, at 614.308-2494 or at the address indicated above. Human Resources Manager White Electronic Designs PHASE 1: estimated last date 4/24/09 Number of ~ EmpIC´ees8ffectetl Area Sales Manager 1 Auditor 1 BusinessAnalyst 1 Director of Sales 1 Doc Control Clerk 1 Eng Lab Technician 1 Finishing Operator 3 HR Assistant 1 Ink Technician 1 Printer 2 Process Engineer 1 Production Assistant 2 Production Lead 1 QA Manager 1 SaeenMaker 1 Sr Printer 1 Test Technician 1 Warehouse Clerk 1 Warehouse Lead 1 23 PHASE 2: estimated last date 5/22/09 Number of Title Employees Affected Auditor Lead 1 Customer Sennce Mgr 1 Design Services Spvr 1 Designer 1 Engineering Mgr 1 Engineering Spvr 1 Finishing Operator 2 Ink Technician 1 Operations Manager 1 Printer 2 Process Engineer 1 Production Assistant 1 Production Spvr 1 Product Engineer 1 Prototype Technician 2 Purchasing Spvr 1 QA Supervisor 1 QA Technician 1 SaeenMaker 1 Shipping Clerk 1 Sr Auditor 1 Sr Printer 3 27 PHASE 3: estimated last date 6/19/09 Number of Title Employees Affected Maintenance Tech II 1 Maintenance Spvr 1 Plant Manager 1 Fac/Safety/Envrn Mgr 1 HR Manager 1 Systems Admin 1 6
