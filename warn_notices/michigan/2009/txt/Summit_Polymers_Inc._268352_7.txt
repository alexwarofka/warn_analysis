Box 30004 canforac@michigan.gov JANO8 2009 Lansing, Ml 48909 (517) 373-6234 RAPIDRE::SPONSEDear Ms. Cantara: WORKFORCEPROGRAMS Recent changes in the economy have resulted in dramatic reduction in the production of North American cars and trucks. Many of our customers have severely reduced their production outputs. This has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the overall business volume of Summit Polymers, Inc. As a result, we have excess capacity that must be reduced to allow Summit to survive. Regrettably, Summit Polymers, lnc.'s Valley Plant located at 3140 East Kilgore Rd., Portage, Ml will be closing permanently at some point between March 9, 2009 and March 23, 2009. Our customers regularly adjust their production schedules, which might result in a slight change in the timing of plant closure. We expect the first permanent terminations resulting from the closure to take place on March 9, 2009. The entire plant will close, which will affect approximately 33 salary employees and 182 hourly employees. Employees do not have "bumping" rights at other Summit Polymers, Inc. locations. The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), Local 2228, represents the hourly workers. UAW International Representative Local Union President (elected) Mr. Randy Sherfield Mr. George Elliot 15802 Hoffman Road 1404 Bank Street Three Rivers, Ml 49093 Kalamazoo, Ml 49001 (269) 279-9776 (269) 615-4100. It is our most sincere desire to do everything we can to help employees affected by this decision. I anticipate you will arrange for meetings to discuss State assistance with the workers. We will be filing an application for Federal Trade Adjustment Assistance for this facility. 6715 S.
