Box 30004  Lansing, MI 48909  RECEIVED  Re:  EAS Saginaw, LLC  2260 Veteran's Memorial Parkway  FEB 1 3 2009  Saginaw, MI 48601  RAPID RESPONSE  WORKFORCE PROGRAMS  Dear Ms. Canfora and Ms. Jones-Ham: We are writing to notify you that, according to the best available information, EAS Saginaw, LLC ("EAS") will completely close its 2260 Veteran's Memorial Parkway facility on or about June 1, 2009. For some time, EAS has been suffering substantial operating losses and searching for a way to restructure its financial condition and its business operations in order to continue operating. EAS was engaged in negotiations with a potential buyer thatwould have enabled EAS to continue operations at this facility. However, on January 29, 2009 those negotiations terminated without reaching a sale agreement A short time before this decision, at the request of its lender, EAS sought legal counsel to prepare a contingency plan. Subsequent to its retention of counsel, EAS had contacted both its major secured creditor and its major customers in an effort to obtain the financing necessary to continue operations at this facility. Despite these efforts, EAS' inability to obtain the necessary financing to continue operations has forced it to liquidate its assets and regrettably, order the closing of the facility. This scheduled closing will affectall employees at the facilities located at the address above. Because there are fewer than 50 employees we do not believe the provisions of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act, 29 U.S.C. 1201 et seq (the "WARN Act") apply; however, we have provided this notice out of an abundance of caution and in an effort to provide the affected employees with notice of the closing in a manner contemplated by the WARN Act. #10538080 vt (!3S792.l) "EXCELLENCE THACUC'lH INNCVPITICN" The Plant closures will be permanent. Bumping rights will not be afforded. Employment separations will begin on May l, 2009 and continue until June l, 2009. Employees in all job classifications will be affected. We are providing a list of the job classifications with the number of affected employees in each classification. In addition to this notice, we have provided notice of the closing to the employee's unions IAW & AW, District Lodge 60, AFL-CIO and 1.A.M. Local Lodge 218, through their respective union representatives, Bobby Atanasovski, One Heritage Place, Suite 550, Southgate, MI 48195 and Gary Motoux, c/o Mueller Brass Co., 2199 Lapeer Ave., Port Huron, MI 48060. For further information, please contact me at 586.755.3180. Sincerely, Rich S.
