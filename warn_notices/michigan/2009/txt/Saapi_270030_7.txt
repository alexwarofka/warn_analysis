Box 30004  Lansing, Ml 48909 Re: SappiFine Paper -Muskegon Mill; Notice of Suspension of Operations and Layoffs Dear Ms. Canfora: Sappi Fine Paper's Muskegon Mill will suspend operations for an extended period of time on or about April 1, 2009. The Muskegon Mill has a mailing address of 2400 Lakeshore Drive, Muskegon, Michigan, 49441. As a result of this suspension of operations, 190 employees employed at the Muskegon Mill are scheduled to be indefinitely laid off on April 1. Both union and non-union employees will be affected by the planned suspension of operations. Affected union employees are represented by two different unions. The great majority of affected union employees are represented by the United Steelworkers Local 1015. USW Local 1015's chief elected official is Howard Ross. Mr. Ross's address is 2341 Lakeshore Drive, Muskegon, Michigan, 49441. A very small number of affected employees are represented by the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals Local 149. The Chief Elected official of SPFPA Local 40 is Derek Schroeder. Mr. Schroeder's address is 1209 Eastmont Drive S.E., Kentwood, Michigan, 49546. Because the Mill's operations will be suspended In their entirety, colleotively bargained bumping rights have little or no application. No bumping rights exist with respect to affected non-union employees. Sappi has prepared, and will make available upon request, a listing of the job titles and positions to be affected and the number of affected employees in each position. In lieu of full 60 days notice required by federal law, Sappi will pay all affected employees who are otheiwise scheduled to work all wages and applicable benefits that would have been earned had those employees been employed for the full 60 day notice period. The Company hopes to resume operations at the Muskegon Mill in approximately six months. If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact me at 231-759-5193. ,s:;;7/~
