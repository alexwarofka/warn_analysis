8 Excellence is our Passion June 2, 2011 VIA FEDERAL EXPRESS Ms. Chong-Anna Canfora, Director Rapid Response Section Michigan Department of Labor & Economic Growth Victor Office Center 201 North Washington Square, 3rd Floor Lansing, Michigan 48913 Dear Director Canfora: As we told you in our earlier letters, Henkel Corporation will close its Port Huron facility located at 1600 Washington Avenue, Port Huron, Michigan 48060. As a result, employment te1minations commenced during a 14-day period beginning on April 22, 2011, however, a few employees asked to leave earlier. We still expect that the employment terminations will be permanent and that the entire facility will be closed. We are now notifying you about another phase of reductions which will result in three (3) additional employees terminating their employment during the 14-day period commencing on August 1, 2011. In addition, the separation dates for a number of employees that were already notified have been extended. This is due to recent business developments which now require Henkel to move more equipment than was originally anticipated. A list of the job titles, number of employees and termination periods of the employees in this phase are located in the enclosed Attachment. We also updated the Attachment to include the revised termination periods for those employees who were notified in earlier phases but have now been extended. This announcement and the above timetable are based on the best information currently available. However, various factors may still affect these plans and the timing of employee separations. You will be informed of any changes as additional information becomes available. The Teamsters Local Union No. 337 represents the hourly production, shipping and maintenance employees at this location. The chief elected officer of that union is Larry Brennan, President, 2801 Tmmbull Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48216. Only very limited bumping rights exist for the unionized employees at the facility. These are described in a Supplemental and Closing Agreement between Henkel and the Union. To the extent that the above actions constitute a covered event under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any other notice law, this letter is intended to Henkel Corporallon  Phone:  810-984-5581  Email Address  1600 Washington Avenue  Fax:  810-984-3135  www.henkelna.com  Port Huron, Michigan, 48060  9 Excellence is our Passion fulfill any requirements imposed under such laws.
