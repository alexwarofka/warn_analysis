This will result in the layoff of 160employees (included in this number previously laid off employees within the last 90 days). Meridian/Magnesium Products of America, Inc. is not part of a union. Meridian/Magnesium Products of America, Inc. manufactures automotive parts. As a result of the dramatic downturn in the automotive industry and the unexpected decision of many customers to extend the December/January plant closures, Meridian/Magnesium Products of America, Inc. will be temporarily or, if things do not improve, permanently idling some of its manufacturing operations. As a result, Meridian/Magnesium Products of America, Inc. is compelled to lay off employees. While Meridian/Magnesium Products of America, Inc. is hopeful that such layoffs will not exceed six months, the fact is that given the current economic climate, the uncertainty future of some or all of the domestic automakers, and financial pressures such layoffs may, ultimately, exceed six months for some, if not all, of the affected employees. All affected employees have been notified.  Bumping rights do not exist.  If you have any questions, please contact me.
