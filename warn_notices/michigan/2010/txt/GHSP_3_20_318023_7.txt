This notice is being provided to comply with the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification {WARN) Act. GHSP's competitive advantage lies in our ability to efficiently combine mechanical and electronic operations. Unfortunately, in order to achieve the level of integration and the overhead reduction necessary to be competitive in our product markets. wewill have to permanently close our GHSP Troy operations facility (located at 307 Robbins Drive, Troy, Ml 48083) and move most of the work from that operation into the GHSP Grand Haven facility. This decision was arrived at after much difficult deliberation. and consideration of all potential options. The table below outlines the anticipated date ranges on which business will leave GHSP Troy and the employees who will experience permanent termination of employment as a result. Employees of GHSP Troy do not have bumping rights, and GHSP retains sole discretion to determine the order and timing of layoffs. This WARN notice will be re-issued to any affected employees If their actual date of separation falls outside the separation date range indicated in the table below. ' l i Employment Termination Date Range  I Employee Name  I 4/16/2010  Luann Davidson  4/16/2010  Barb Hunter  4/16/2010  Christina Penberthy  4/16/2010  Jolanta Swieca  4/16/2010  Amy Campbell  ! 4/16/2010  Debbie Moralee  4/16/2010  Hussam Victor  4/16/2010  Zack Hugill  ' For further information, please do not hesitate to contact me at {616) 847-3179.
