Turner : As the Company announced several months ago, and in accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, this is official notice that Shiloh Industries, Inc., Mansfield Blanking Plant located at 402 Ninth Avenue, Mansfield OH 44905 will be implementing a plant closure. It is anticipated the plant closure will be completed during calendar year 2011 and is expected to be permanent. This closure will result in a permanent employment loss for all of the current remaining employees. We hope to accomplish this plant closure with the least possible disruption to the lives of our employees and the community. Approximately 87 positions at the facility will be permanently terminated during the fourteen (14) day period of August 19, 2011 and September 2, 2011 and will result in permanent employment loss for those employees . The remaining terminations and the specific information relating to those terminations will be communicated to you in accordance with the appropriate notice requirements. The majority of the workers at the facility are covered by a collective bargaining agreement between Shiloh Industries, Inc., Mansfield Blanking Plant and United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union and Local 7679. The union officers are: Leo Gerard, President, USW, Five Gateway Center, Pittsburgh PA 15222; Larry Guill, Staff Representative, USW, 1340 West Fourth St., Mansfield OH 44906; and Judson Prosser, Local President, USW, 402 Ninth Avenue, Mansfield OH 44905. Additionally, certain of the employees may have bumping rights under the collective bargaining agreement to possibly obtain other positions within the facility. However, at present, the Company does not know which, if any, employees may exercise their bumping rights . Further, there are no bumping rights to other facilities, and there will be no positions within the facility at the time it closes. There are no bumping rights either within or outside of the facility for employees who are not covered by the collective bargaining agreement. If you have any questions, please contact Human Resources, Gary Hall by telephone at (419) 525-9268 or by mail at Shiloh Industries, Inc., Mansfield Blanking Plant, 402 Ninth Avenue, Mansfield OH 44905. Very truly yours, GK/psw Attachment -List of Positions Affected 2
