Dear Ms. Hennessey: The purpose of this letter is to advise you that Visteon Corporation will be permanently laying off the employment of approximately 710 UAW Local 892 employees who are presently teased to Automotive Components Holdings, LLC ("ACH") and work at ACH's Plant located at 7700 Michigan Avenue, Saline, Michigan 48176. The layoff is due to ACH's notification to Visteon that it will no longer require the services of these employees. It is anticipated that these employees will be impacted by this action beginning on February 16, 2009 and will end on April 27, 2009 as indicated by the attached schedule. These reductions may be affected in the interim by a number of factors, e.g., quits or other changes to the workforce. As a result, it is difficult to identify exactly which employees will be laid off. Bumping rights exist for these employees and will be handled by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. The Plant Chairman is Pete Graham. Mr. Graham's address is 7700 Michigan Avenue, Saline, Ml 48176. His telephone number is (734) 429-5140, ext. 12. The Director of UAW Region 1A, is Rory Gamble, 9650 S. Telegraph Road, Taylor, Ml 48180.

Dear Ms. Hennessey: The purpose of this letter is to update a letter to you from John Harju dated October 16, 2008 regarding the timing of the permanent layoffs of the 120 UAW Local 892 Visteon hourly employees assigned to the Automotive Components Holdings, LLC ("ACH") Saline Plant. These employees were to be permanently laid off between December 14 and December 28, 2008 due to AC H's notification to Visteon that it would no longer require the services of these employees. ACH has now informed us that in order to provide adequate supplies of inventory to meet future customer needs, it is necessary to retain these approximately 120 employees through January 19, 2009. It is anticipated that these 120 employees will be permanently laid off between January 19 and February 16. 2009 according to the following schedule: Estimated Schedule Approximately 40 employees January 19, 2009 through February 2, 2009 
Approximately 40 employees January 26, 2009 through February 9, 2009 
Approximately 40 employees February 2, 2009 through February 16, 2009 
All of the approximately 120 affected employees hold the position of Production Associate. The Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Company and UAW Local 892 provides a method for such reductions in the workforce and as such bumping rights exist for these employees. These reductions may be affected in the interim by a number of factors, e.g., quits or other changes to the workforce. As a result it is difficult to identify exactly which employees will be laid off. Bumping rights exist for these employees and will be handled by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. The Plant Chairman is Pete Graham. Mr. Graham's address is 7700 Michigan Avenue, Saline, Ml 48176. His telephone number is (734) 429-5140. ext. 12.
