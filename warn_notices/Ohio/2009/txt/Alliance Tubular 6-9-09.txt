Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216-1618 Re: Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification ("WARN") Act Notice Dear Mr. Valentine: Recent economic events have resulted in sudden and unexpected reverses for Alliance Tubular Products Co. (the "Company") and its business at the Alliance, Ohio facility. The severity of the business downturn has dramatically decreased orders from our customers. We had expected and hoped that this business downturn would be brief. However, the downturn has become more severe with no reasonable forecast for recovery. Because of these business conditions the Company has had to make layoffs at the Alliance plant. While we expect the layoffs will be temporary, it now appears that they may be of indefinite duration. The Company is therefore providing you with formal notice pursuant to the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. ¤ 2101 et seq. The affected location is the Company's Alliance Plant located at 640 Keystone Street, Alliance, OH 44601. Attached hereto is a list of job titles of the positions that have been affected and the number of employees in each such classification. Union-Represented Employees: The hourly bargaining unit employees have bumping rights that are governed by the seniority provisions contained in the collective bargaining agreement. Such employees are represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied, Industrial and Service Workers International Union, Local 3059.01. The names and addresses of the chief elected officials of the international and local union are as follows: Leo W. Gerard 
International President 
United Steelworkers 
Five Gateway Center 
Pittsburgh, PA 15222 
Joseph Holcomb

Michael Johnson 
President 
USW Local 3059-01 
10710 Julie Ave. 
Alliance, OH 44601 
Non-Union Represented Employees: These affected employees do not have bumping rights to displace other workers. We expect all of these layoffs to be temporary in nature and that all laid off employees will be recalled to employment as soon as business conditions permit. The information and notice in this letter are based on the best information currently available. We will keep you informed of any significant changes to the information above if and when such changes occur. If you have any questions or need further information regarding this matter, please contact me at 330-829-5263. Very truly yours, ~PyManager, Human Resources -North America Encl. ALLIANCE, OHIO
