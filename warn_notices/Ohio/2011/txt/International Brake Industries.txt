("IBI"), plant, in Lima, Ohio, for all intents and purposes will be closed this Spring. As the plant terminates the production component of its business in Lima, our employees will suffer a mass layoff. As a result of this action, almost all of the positions at this plant will be eliminated and, with only a few exceptions, all persons at the plant will be terminated. The separation from employment will be permanent. There is a collective bargaining agreement ("CBA") in existence between IBI and Local 975 of the International Union of the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America ("Union"). The parties to the CBA are fully informed and have negotiated a plant closure agreement. Nonetheless, notice of this mass layoff is given this same day to the Union: Dan Hinegardner, International Representative UAW Local 975 Region 2-B Dayton Sub-Regional Office 1155-D Lyons Road Dayton, Ohio 45458 937-433-1524 It is anticipated that the following job classifications will experience layoffs between May 9, 2011, and May 20, 2011: Table Worker 	16 1840 McCullough St.¥ Lima, Ohio 45801-3098 ¥ Tel. 419 227-4421 FAX: Admin. 419 993-8176 ¥ Sales/Marketing 419 993-8177 ¥ QC/Eng. 419 993-8166 Jean Ann Carlson March 9, 2011 Page 2 Table Head 16

Total: 73 Because the CBA provides for bumping rights, individual names of employees who will suffer an employment loss starting on May 9, 2011, cannot be determined until IBI and the Union sit down to determine the rights of each employee. Between May 20, 2011, and June 3, 2011, the following additional classifications will experience a job loss: Table Worker 32 Machine Operator 10 Material Handler 27 Inspector 3 Group Leader 6 Janitor 2 Total 80 These individuals may also have some bumping rights under the CBA.
