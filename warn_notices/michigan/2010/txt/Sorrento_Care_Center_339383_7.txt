Chong-Anna Canfora, Director Rapid Response Section Michigan Department of Labor & Economic Growth Victor Office Center 201 N. Washington Sq., 3rd Floor Lansing, Michigan 48913 October 5, 201 O Dear Ms. Canfora, The purpose of this letter is to inform you that, as of September 28, 2010, Sorrento Care Center located at 12900 West Chicago, Detroit, Michigan, 48228 received notice from the Michigan Department of Community Health that based on the recent surveys and because Sorrento is a special focus facility, the Department is recommending that Sorrento's Medicare and Medicaid participation be terminated effective October 12, 2010. On September 29, 201 O,Sorrento provided notice to the State that it will voluntarily terminate its Medicare and Medicaid participation as a result the facility will close as soon as residents are transferred to other facilities. The closure is expected to be permanent. Layoffs will begin immediately based upon the facility census and minimum staffing guidelines while the State conducts its controlled process of determining placement of all the residents into area nursing homes. Attached is a list of the affected positions and the names of employees currently holding those positions or expected to be affected: It is anticipated that approximately 123 employees will be affected by the action. Those employees do not have bumping rights that would apply in the case of the facilities closure. For further information regarding this matter, please contact me at 313-491-7830. RECEIVED IN 10::(G ~ OCT O 6 2010 ~. Diana Eggleston ~ Administrator RAPIDRESPONSE .................................. 1111111111 .
