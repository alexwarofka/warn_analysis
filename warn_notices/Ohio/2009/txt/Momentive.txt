Box 1618 Columbus, Ohio 43216 This letter serves as notice pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), of a series of layoffs impacting employees of Momentive Performance Materials ("Momentive'') at the Quartz Plant located at 4901 Campbell Road Willoughby, Ohio 44094. As a result of the ongoing economic crisis, Momentive has been forced to make a series of reductions in production operations at the Willoughby facility. From January 2009 through April 13, 2009, the Willoughby facility announced that a series of temporary layoffs were being made permanent for 34 employees due to volume reductions. On March 4, 2009 the Company also announced a tentative transfer of work to the collective bargaining unit and is conducting decision bargaining negotiations. The tentative transfer of work could affect 80 salaried and hourly employees in Willoughby. Due to continued depressed economic conditions, on May 4, 2009 the Company announced the reduction of an additional twenty-three employees effective May 11, 2009. The Company could not provide a 60-day notice that far in advance due to unforeseeable business circumstances regarding the dramatic downturn in the national economy and the above described significant volume losses from our customer base. Given the economic climate, the Company was simply unable to forecast sixty days into the future. Management personnel of the Willoughby facility continuously communicated with its employees regarding the impact of the economy on the business and the decline in order rates. During plant meetings, employees were counseled on the status of the business and the possibility of layoffs if the order rates continued to fall. Please contact me directly at 440-953-7405 if you require additional information.
