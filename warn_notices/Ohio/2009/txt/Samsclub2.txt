We announced to our associates that the Club will close effective today, May 6, 2009. We have tried to improve the financial performance of the club for several years. While our associates enthusiastically embraced those efforts, it is with disappointment that we have decided to discontinue our operations. I want you to understand that our foremost goal is to take care of our associates. The Sam's Club in Willoughby Hills employs approximately 130 associates. All associates will receive 60 days pay immediately and will be eligible for employment at area Walmart stores and Sam's Club locations. Sam's Club will host a job fair for Willoughby Hills associates in which we will provide guidance as they apply for positions at other Walmart stores or Sam's Club locations. We provide you this information pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C . ¤¤2101 et~-("WARN").
