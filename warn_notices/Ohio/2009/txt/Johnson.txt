Re: JOHNSON CONTROLS, INC.-PLANT CLOSING Dear Mr. Weber: Please be advised that, on or around July 19, 2009, Johnson Controls, Inc. will permanently close its facility located at 1147 North Washington St., Greenfield, Ohio 45123. The separations of the affected employees are expected to occur in five waves. Consistent with these plans, the last day of employment for the affected employees is anticipated to be one of the following dates: ¥ July 17, 2009, or within two weeks thereafter; ¥ August 7, 2009, or within two weeks thereafter; ¥ August 14, 2009, or within two weeks thereafter; ¥ September 15, 2009, or within two weeks thereafter; or ¥ October 15, 2009, or within two weeks thereafter. Approximately 4 7 of the hourly employees that are scheduled to be permanently laid off on July 17, 2009, will be temporarily laid off on May 11, 2009, due to the unforeseeable business circumstance of Chrysler LLC's announcement on Thursday, April 30, 2009, that it planned to temporarily idle most of its manufacturing operations, effective Monday, May 4, 2009. If the situation with Chrysler changes, there is a possibility that the temporarily laid off employees may return to work between May 11, 2009, and July 17, 2009. Chrysler's announcement has also impacted other recent staffing decisions and likely will continue to impact staffing decisions in the future. DETR_ 1138802.2 A list of the affected job classifications and number of employees per classification is attached. Some of these employees are represented by the United Auto Workers, Local 1842. Union inquiries should be directed to Esto Haithcock, President, United Auto Workers, Local 1842, at 1147 North Washington St., Greenfield, Ohio 45123, or via telephone at (937) 981.2176. All terminated employees will be paid all earned wages and agreed-upon fringe benefits upon termination. The plant closing will be permanent and limited bumping rights will exist for represented employees. No bumping rights will exist for umepresented employees. For further information regarding this matter, please contact me at Johnson Controls, Inc., 1147 North Washington St., Greenfield, Ohio 45123, or via telephone at (937) 981-2176, ext. 6536. Human Resources Manager Attachment 2 DETR_ 1138802.2 AFFECTED JOB CLASSIFICATIONS & NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES PER CLASSIFICATION Date of Anticipated Layoff July 17, 2009 (or within two weeks thereafter) August 7, 2009 (or within  1.
