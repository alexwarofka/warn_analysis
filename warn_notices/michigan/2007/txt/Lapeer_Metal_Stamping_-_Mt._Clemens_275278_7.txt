They commenced on October 10, 2007 and we anticipate permanent separations/terminations may continue through on or about March of 2008. Changes in timing of the permanent separations/terminations resulted from customer needs and logistic and financial issues related to the Company's reorganization. As a result, it is anticipated that approximately50 employees overall wiUbe permanently separated/terminated from employment at the Company's Mt.
