Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. ¤ 2101 et seq. 
Dear Mr. Turner: This notice is being sent to you as the chief executive of Ohio's dislocated worker unit, the agency to which notice must be sent regarding a plant closing, pursuant to Section 2102( a)(2) of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN") (29 U.S.C. Sections 2101 et~). I am giving you notice that Plastech Engineered Products, Inc. ("Plastech" or the "Company") intends to permanently close its assembly and sequencing facility located at 21819 Royalton Road, Strongsville, Ohio 44149 (the "Strongsville Facility"), and will begin to wind down its stamping business effective, July 1, 2008. As a result of this closing, themajority of employees at the Strongsville Facility were terminated as of July 04, 2008", except for a few employees who will be winding down the business at the Strongsville Facility whose employment will be terminated on July 15, 2008 or within the fourteen (14) days thereafter. The terminations will be permanent and will affect employees in all job titles. A total of 43 employees will be affected. A list of the job titles of those employees who will be affected, complete with an indication of the number of individuals classified under each such job title, is attached. None of the displaced employees will possess bumping rights. The closing of the Strongsville Facility and the separation of its employees with less than sixty days notice is being done under the "unforeseeable business circumstances" exception to WARN. 29 U.S.C. 2102(b )(2)(A). Earlier this year the Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United State Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division. For the last several months Plastech has been in active negotiations regarding the sale of its stamping business that would include the transfer of employees to the purchaser. The Company and the purchaser, on April 30, 2008, entered into a letter of intent which stated the purchaser's intention to acquire substantially all of the assets of Plastech's stamping business and retain all employees necessary for the ongoing operations of the stamping business. On June 18, 2008, the parties entered into a final Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the purchaser was required to hire substantially all of the employees of Plastech 
21819 Royalton Rd., Strongsville, OH 44136 Phone: (440) 572-3322 ¥ Fax: (440) 572-4255 the Strongsville Facility. The Company learned on June 30, 2008, the day of the scheduled closing of the sale would not be consummated. As a result, General Motors, the Company's largest stamping customer, will be removing its business from the Cleveland Facility and, unfortunately, the Company no longer has sufficient funds to maintain operations for the Stamping Division. If circumstances regarding the Strongsville Facility change, you will be advised. If you have any questions please contact me at 440-572-3322. Si.nc_e.rel~, ~-:> ~~>/ ?~ Terr~ Plant Manager Enclosure Plastech Strongsville Job Titles and Number of Employees affected by the Plant Closing.
