(including its affiliate Interstate Brands Corporation, "Hostess" or the "Company") filed for chapter 11 relief on January 11, 2012 (the "Filing"). The Company has been actively engaged in discussions with various lenders and potential purchasers regarding Hostess' restructuring both before and after the Filing. Our primary focus is to complete our restmcturing of the Company and emerge from chapter 11 as a viable company. However, it is possible that, despite our best efforts, certain c,,cnts may occur that would require Hostess to sell all or portions of its business and/ or wind down its operations and liquidate. Despite the uncertainty of what may happen, the federal \'{forker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and certain related State statutes (collectively, ''\'{1 ARN") generally require employers to provide advance notice in the event of certain covered employment actions. To comply with any\'{! ARN obligations Hostess may have, this letter is intended to give you conditional notice that, based upon the best .information reasonably available to Hostess at this time, it is possible that one of the following events may occur: ¥ 	The board of directors aud1orizes, or seeks court authorization for, the pursuit of a sale of all or a 
substantial portion of all of Hostess' assets; 
¥ 	The board of directors audmrizes, or seeks court authorization for, Hostess to stop pursuing the 
restructuring of its business; 
¥ 	More than 20'Yoof Hostess' aggregate workforce is hid off after Jatmary 11, 2012; ¥ 	Hostess receives an unsatisfactory resolution of its pending motion before the bankruptcy court regarding certain modifications to its coUect.ive bargaining agreements with the Bakers and/or the Teamsters; ¥ 	There is a strike, walkout, lockout, slowdown or od1er work stoppage that is likely to have a material 6031 Connection Drive, Irving, TX 75039 -(972) 532-4500 adverse effect on I-Iostess; or ¥ 	Hostess seeks bankruptcy court approval to co1nn1encc a sale of property \Vhile in bankiuptcy ,vhich accounts for n1ore than 20¡/o of Hostess' consolidated net sales as reported on Hostess' financial statetnents for the t,velve-tnonth period prececfu1gJanuary l 1, 2012. If one of these events occurs, Hostess 1nay begii1 the process of pe11nanently ceasing operations, and significantly scaling down operations at its Livonia lvII -37051 Amrhein located at 37051 Amrhein, Llvonia, l\H 48150-1105, as early as 60 days fron1 the receipt of tllls notice.
