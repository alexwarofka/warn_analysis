The reduction in workforce is due to excess inventory resulting from reduced demand. Based on the best information now available, the Company may temporarily separate as many as fifty (50) or more employees on or about October 17, 2009. In accordance with WARN requirements, laid off employees will receive pay through this date and benefits through October 2009. Should business conditions or customer needs cause us to change this timeline, I will let you know. Please refer to the attached document which identifies the job positions and number of persons employed in such positions that may be affected by the temporary reduction in workforce. Due to this notice being given at least 60 days in advance of and in preparation for the temporary reduction in workforce, Cemex, Inc. does not yet know the exact number of bargaining unit employees who will be affected by this action. CEMEX Fairborn Plant management will be working with and through Union Local D-357 to identify which bargaining unit job positions will be affected and after such employees exercise their bumping rights both parties will know which employees will be retained and which will be separated. A WARN notice has been provided to (a) Mark Kelly, International Representative, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, 15 Brentwood Drive, McKee Rocks, PA 15136 who represents the affected employees at the facility and (b) Phil Nawman, President, Union Local D-357. The Company will work with and through Green County Job & Family Services to provide assistance to affected employees.
