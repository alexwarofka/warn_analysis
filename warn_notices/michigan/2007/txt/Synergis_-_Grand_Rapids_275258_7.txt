November 9, 2007 To our fellow employees at the Bristol Avenue facility: This Jetter is to inform you of Synergis' plan to close our business, including the facility where you work, located at 2066 Bristol Avenue, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Because of the circumstances, we do not believe that earlier notice of this reduction in force was possible under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. However, we are providing you with as much notice as we can under the circumstances, The closing will begin today, November 9, 2007. It involves the entire 361" Street facility, and will be permanent. Your last day worked is expected to be today, or within 14 days after today. There are no bumping rights available. You are not to report for work on Monday unless you are specifically advised to do so by your supervisor. This plant closing and liquidation of the business of Synergis is due to the inability of Synergis to obtain adequate financing and new business to allow the business to survive. We have tried desperately to work with lenders and customers to avoid the need to close. Our situation was made worse by some important existing customers who recently and unexpectedly notified Synergis that the continuation of work by Synergis on their projects would be delayed, creating a severe cash flow shortage. The situation has been volatile these past several days, but we were able to make payroll yesterday and intend to meet payroll obligations as we wind down and conclude our operations. If you have any questions regarding this, please contact Human Resources Manager Sharon Bevier, at 616-475-3244, for further information. Sincerely, Synergis Technologies Group Corporation 3155 36th Street SEá Grand Rapids,Michigan 49512 ¥ U.S.A á P 616 245.4400 ¥ F.á 616.415.3204 á www.synerg,s.us
