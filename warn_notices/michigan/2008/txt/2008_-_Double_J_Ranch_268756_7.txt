SEP 12 2008 RAPIDRESPONSE WORKFORCEPROGRAMS RE: Notice of Mass Layoff Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (''WARN") This notice is being given to you under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988("WARN"). WARN requires employers to give official notice to certain govern.mental units or officials of a pending plant closing or mass layoff. As you may be aware, Double JJ Ranch has been in operation for more than 70 years. Due to the ongoing depressed economy in Michigan and legal claims initiated by creditors, Double JJ found it necessary to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 18, 2008. Our numerous attempts to secure financing and/or sell Double JJ have proven unsuccessful. As a result, Double JJ will discontinue operations on September 3, 2008 and 243 employees at the Company's facility at 5900 S. Water Street. Rothbury. Michigan will be permanently laid off. Employees have no bumping rights under Company policy. We apologize for not providing you with additional notice, but we have been working diligently to obtain financing and to sell the business. While we have secured sufficient financing for the anticipated sale. we were informed late last week by the lenders that the financing necessary to support ongoing operations would not be provided. As a result, the decision was made to suspend operations at the resort. As noted above, the layoffs will commence on September 3, 2008. Attached is a list of employees and job titles affected by the discontinuance of our operations, including separation dates. Double JJ regrets that this action is necessary. If you have any questions, please contact Greg Mottashed at (231) 894-3907, Respectfully,-<:::\ . . To~~
