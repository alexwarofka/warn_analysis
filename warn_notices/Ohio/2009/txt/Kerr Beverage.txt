June 16, 2009 VIA FACSIMILE (614.728.5938) AND FEDERAL EXPRESS Mr. Jeff Calhoun Chief, Rapid Response Section Bureau of Workforce Services Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) Act P.O. Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216-1618 Re: Notice of Facility Closing Dear Mr. Calhoun: This letter serves to advise you that Kerr Beverage Company ("Kerr" or "the Company") has made the decision to sell all assets, including distribution rights, to Superior Beverage Group ("Superior") and to NWO Beverage, Inc. ("NWO"). All distribution rights in Lorain, Erie (excluding Kelly's Island) and Huron Counties (and related assets) will be sold to Superior, and all distribution rights in our remaining counties (Ottawa, Sandusky and Seneca including Kelly's Island in Erie County) (and related assets) will be sold to NWO. It is anticipated that the closing will take place on or about July 17, 2009. Once that occurs, all operations of Kerr, at our sole facility in Lorain, will cease and all employees will be terminated, as a layoff. We have provided the employees, individually or through their labor organization representative, with advance notice of their termination date. Although not anticipated at this time, we do recognize that a facility closing may occur prior to July 17, 2009 due to circumstances beyond the Company's control or unforeseeable business circumstances. All jobs at the facility, numbering approximately 25 bargaining unit employees and about 31 non-bargaining employees (including management and supervision), will be eliminated. A list of the affected positions, with the number of employees in each -one for the bargaining unit and the other for non-unit positions --is attached. Affected bargaining unit employees are represented by Teamsters Local Union No. 20, which has also been notified of this sale and "Quality Beverages from Quality Peopleá closure. At this point, we do not know the buyers' intentions as to whether they will hire any of these employees. If you have any questions, or if you need further information regarding this permanent closing, please feel free to contact me. I can be reached at 740.593.3353. We appreciate the support you and the State of Ohio have given the workforce and management over the years, and we will do our best to ease the transition for those impacted. Very truly yours, R Executive Vice President Encl. ,.__, = = -= (J) -! KERRBEVERGECOMPANY NON-UNION PERSONNEL JUNE 16, 2009 GENERAL MANAGER DELIVERY & WH SUPERVISOR Andrews, Michael J. SALES MANAGER Hennes, Thomas D. SALES SUPERVISOR Albright, Shari L.
