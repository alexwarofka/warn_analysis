Please allow this letter to serve as written notice that effective December 31, 2010, St. John Senior Community will be sold and St. John Providence Health System will cease all of its operations at that facility. Accordingly, none of the individuals who may continue working at St. John Senior Community after December 31, 2010 will be employees of St. John Providence Health System. As we are currently working with all Senior Community associates to provide a smooth transition to all possible employment oppo1iunities, it is impossible to estimate the number of individuals who will experience a true employment loss as a result of the December 31, 2010 sale. (Notably, no bumping rights will exist.) Notice of this action has also been provided to our affected employees and to the Mayor of the City of Detroit. Should you need any further information with respect to the foregoing, please contact the undersigned at the above-referenced address or at 586-753-0718. á Mary Naber Sr. Vice President St. John Providence Health System 	.RECEIVEDIN NCJVG4 2010 RAPIDRESPONSE
