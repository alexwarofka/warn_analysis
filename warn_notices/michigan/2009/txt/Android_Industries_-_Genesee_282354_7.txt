Chong-Anna Caafora, Director Rapid Resp0nse Section Michigan Department of Labor & Economic Growth 611 West Ottawa Street, 4th Floor P.O. Box 30004 Lansing, Michigan 48909 Dear Ms. Canfora: The purpose of this letter is to inform you that unforeseen business circumstances will force National Archive Publishing Company ("NAPC") to permanently layoff a majority of its workforce at its faltering Scio Township, Michigan fucilitylocated at 300 North Zeeb Road, P.O. Box 998, Ann Arbor, MI 48106-0998 (the "Scio facility"). As of the date of this letter, approximately 209 employees remain at NAPC's Scio facility. Approximately 120 employees will be pe!Illllllently separated between June 15, 2009 and June 29, 2009. An unforeseen reduction in-NAPC business and increase in NAPC's operating costs has made this mass layoff inevitable. While NAPC has made every attempt to save jobs by seeking new capital and pursuing a sale of the business in which employees would retain their positions, management has determined that these layoffs are the only option at this time. NAPC continues to explore all options for its manufacturing operation with potential buyers, but can make no guarantee as to the success of these efforts. Should you have any questions, please contact Jeremy Little at (734) 302-6732. Sincerely, NAPC Management RECEIVED JUN 1 O 2009 RAPlf' :,:: :, .j,,JS _
