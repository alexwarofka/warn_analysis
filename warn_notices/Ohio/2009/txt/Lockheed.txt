Employees are currently in the process of applying for positions through the government application system. Whether or not they receive employment through the government system, all Lockheed Martin employees will receive layoffs. Accordingly, we have notified our employees and are hereby notifying your office that we will have to lay off one-third or more of our workforce in at least 60 days from today's date or January 31, 2010.
