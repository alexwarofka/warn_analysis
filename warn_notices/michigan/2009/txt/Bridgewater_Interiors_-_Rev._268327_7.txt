Washington Square WORKFORCEPROGRAMSLansing, MI 48913 Re: BRIDGEWATER INTERIORS, INC.-MASS LAYOFF .UNFORESEEABLE BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES REVISED NOTICE Dear Ms. Hennessey: As indicated in my previous letter, on or around February 2, 2009, Bridgewater Interiors, Inc. ("Bridgewater") will permanently layoff a number of employees at its facility located at 2369 S. Canal Road, Lansing, Ml 48917. The separations are expected to occur in four waves. Consistent with those plans, the last day of employment for the affected employees is anticipated to be one of the following dates: ¥ December 23, 2008; ¥ January 30, 2009, or \\1thin two weeks thereafter; ¥ February 13, 2009, or within two weeks thereafter; or ¥ February 27, 2009, or within two weeks thereafter. The revisions noted above to the separation schedule only apply to the non-union employees who are affected by the mass layoff on February 2, 2009. Bridgewater was informed on Monday, January 26, 2009, that General Motors planned to eliminate its second shift, effective February 2, 2009, at the Lansing facility. Unfortunately, this sudden, dramatic, and unexpected action was unforeseeable, without notice, and outside of Bridgewater's control. This is the reason that Bridgewater was unable to give sixty (60) days advance notice of the mass layoff. A revised list of the affected job classifications and number of employees per classification is attached. Some of these employees are represented by the UAW Local 724. Union inquiries should be directed to Melvin Coleman, UAW International Representative, Region IC, 1940 West Atherton Road, Flint, Ml 48507, or via telephone at (810) 767-0910. DETR_10925011 All terminated employees will be paid all earned wages and agreed-upon fringe benefits upon termination. The layoffs will be permanent and limited bumping rights will exist for represented employees. No bumping rights will exist for unrepresented employees. For further information regarding this matter, please contact me at Bridgewater Inter:iors, Inc., 2369 S. Canal Road, Lansing, MI 48917, or via telephone at (517) 322-4805. Sircerely, CY~,, .. "-y-á LaTonya McKee Human Resources Supervisor Attachment 2 DETR_ 1092501.1 ,--------------------------------------,AFFECTED JOB CLASSIFICATIONS & NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES PER CLASSIFICATION Date of Anticipated Layoff  Aftected Job Classification(s)  Numb.er of Employees Per Classification  December 23, 2008  Seatmg Assembly LSA Assembly Overheads Assembly Rework Material Handling  73 10 15 2 14  ,---~----~~--+-~ January 30, 2009 ( or within two weeks thereafter) February 13, 2009 ( or within two weeks thereafter) Maintenance -Electrical 1 Maintenance ¥ Mechanical 3 _ __J IT Technician 1 Production Supervisor 4 Quality Engineer 1 Quality Technician 2 ' Shipping Receivin.g Clerk I 1 --------..---~---~----IH&S Coordinator 1 1Maintenance Supervisor February 27. 2009 (or 1, within t\vo weeks HR Specialist ....1 th_er_e_aft_e_r.._)______ __._________ ~---------'---------------' OETR_1092514.1
