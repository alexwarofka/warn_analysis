The merger of the two organizations and conversion of our systems results in certain redundancies between National City and PNC operations, which in tum results in the need to restructure certain of our businesses and departments, and the elimination of certain businesses that are inconsistent with our business model going forward. Please be advised this possible "plant closing" results in the elimination of a total of 70 positions. I. For purpose of this notice only, we have concluded that the relevant affected employment site is 400 West Fourth Street, Royal Oak, Michigan. The name and telephone number of the company official to contact for further information is Brian Ferguson, Vice President, Human Resources (412) 768-8500. 2. The displacements occurring as a result of the merger are expected to be permanent. 3. Unless they obtain employment elsewhere within PNC or with another employer prior to their expected date of displacement, the emplo:,ment of the 70 employees at the Royal Oak, Michigan location is expected to be terminated according to the following schedule: During the 14-day period beginning on April 26, 2010 28 employees 
During the 14-day period beginning on June 25, 2010 8 employees 
During the 14-day period beginning on July 2, 2010 34 employees
