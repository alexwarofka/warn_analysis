Clinton, Michigan 49236 
Dear Chong-Anna Canfora: In compliance with the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining NotificationAct ("WARN Act"), 29 U.S.C. 210! et~. this is to notify you that, accordingto th\l best available infonnation, Pilkington will completely close its Clinton, Michigan facility. We anticipate the phased closure will be completed by the end of summer 2010. The current economic downturn and its direct effect on the Automotivtá industry are continuing to have an impact on our Automotive volumes in NorthAmerica. The unprecedented drop in demand and the reduction of future orders means there is insufficient work to keep the Clinton operation viable going fo?Ward. According to the btlst possible i.nfonnation at this time. the number of employees that will be pexmanently affected is 130. Employees at all job positions are subject to this closing. We are providing a list of the job clas5ifications with the names and the number of affected employees in each classification. Employment separations are anticipated to begin on January2, 2010 and continue until September 30, 2010. For further information, please contact Brian Stierle at 517.456-2141. Sincerely, ,J,~,Lj, ..:;lt/rn,ál.tlI-. Gregor/1nonJ./ tf,,11
