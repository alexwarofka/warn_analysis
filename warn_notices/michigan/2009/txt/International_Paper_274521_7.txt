Dear Director Canfora: On January 23, 2009, I wrote to inform you that International Paper Company had decided to close its Howell, Michigan Plant located at 1450 McPherson Park Drive, Howell, Michigan 48843. In light of the requirements of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, I also provided you information listing the job titles of positions to be affected by this decision, the number of affected employees in each job classification, and the anticipated schedule (between March 24, 2009 and April 6, 2009) of those job eliminations. I now am writing to inform you that we have determined that, due to business circumstances, we will be able to continue to employ a limited number of the identified employees until dates later than those anticipated when I sent the earlier WARN notice letter. Attached to this letter is a listing of the job titles of the positions that we are able to extend, the number of employees in each classification, and the new dates for the job eliminations. If you should need any additional information, please feel free to contact me at 585-752-1884. Respectfully, ~[\,,/;~ Donna '-i-;\;d
