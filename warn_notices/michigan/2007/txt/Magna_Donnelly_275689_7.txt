Dear Ms. Hennessey: Regrettably, due to our current business circumstances, Magna Donnelly Grand Haven has found it necessary to lay off employees from their positions at the facility located at 1800 Hayes St, Grand Haven, MI 49417, which will be closing. Although we hope that there may be other employment opportunities for some employees, these layoffs must be considered permanent The layoffs will initially affect 95 employees. Exact dates of the layoffs have not been determined, but they will begin no earlier than October 8, 2007 and no later than October 22, 2007. At this time, it is expected that an additional 212 employees will be laid off as lay offs will continue through December 31, 2007. To the extent that these layoffs constitute a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, this letter is intended to fulfill the Act's requirements. By providing this letter, however, Magna Donnelly Grand Haven does not concede that the Act applies or that notices are otherwise required. For further information, please contact me at 616-844-8001. Sincerely, ~WJvr~ RECE\VEDJessica Williams Human Resources Manager Magna Donnelly, Grand Haven t,.1.)G081001 ¥!\\MAGNA MAGNA DONNELLY October 5, 2007 Deb Hennessey, Section Manager Bureau of Workforce Program 201 N.
