Box 1618 Columbus, Ohio 43216 Re: Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Dear Michael: This notice is being provided to you pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires employers to give official notice to certain government units or officials of a mass layoff. Thomas & Betts continuously reviews our manufacturing strategy with the purpose of streamlining operations and increasing efficiencies. As a part of that overall effort, we will be permanently relocating all of the manufacturing operations at the Cleveland, Ohio manufacturing plant, located at 4000 East 116th Street and 11730 Harvard A venue, Cleveland, Ohio. All employees associated with manufacturing operations as well as the support personnel will be permanently laid off. In accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, we will begin notifying employees this week of their expected separation dates. It is anticipated that the referenced operations will cease in stages commencing November 23, 2009 and this action will be completed on or about March 31, 2010. Because this move will occur in stages, we will notify employees as soon as possible regarding their anticipated end date. We are committed to meet with employees at least one week prior to their end date and, if we are not able to do so, we will pay them for a week's notice. Attached to this letter is Exhibit A showing the job titles of the positions to be affected, the number of affected employees, and the names of the workers currently holding the affected jobs. Bumping rights, for hourly employees, will apply as provided in Article VI, Section 3of the Labor Agreement between the Union and the Company. Because there is no policy establishing bumping rights for salaried employees, and there has been no past practice of bumping, bumping rights will not apply to the affected salaried employees. The plant's hourly bargaining employees are represented by IUE-CWA Union. The representative of this union is John Bodeker, President IUE-CWA Local 84778. His address is 1327 Catherine Drive, Brunswick, Ohio 44212. The Company intends to assist all laid off employees in obtaining any benefits that may be available to them from the state and local government, as well as providing assistance in obtaining other employment opportunities. In addition, Thomas & Betts has established a severance plan for salaried employees. For further information or clarification please contact Karen McHugh, Human Resources Manager, at 216-377.3305. ~~
