June 30, 2008 Dislocated Worker Unit Jobs and Family Services 4020 E. 5th Ave. Columbus, Ohio 43219 To Whom It May Concern: Tekni-Plex, Inc (together with its subsidiaries, the "Company") operates the Swan Hose manufacturing facility at 201 E. Beal Avenue, Bucyrus, OH 44820. Although the Company would prefer to maintain consistent employment levels at all its facilities, fluctuations in business conditions and the seasonal demand for garden hoses make it virtually impossible for us to maintain steady employment levels at the Bucyrus plant. Unless current demand levels for the products we produce at Bucyrus are sustained indefinitely, the Company will have no alternative but to have another reduction in force. We want to give our employees advance notice that layoffs may again become necessary. We currently expect layoffs at the Bucyrus Facility will occur on or about August 29, 2008, and will affect the employees listed below. The job titles and number of the affected employees are listed below: Job Title Number of Affected Employees Rubber Spiral Line Operator 6 
Vulcanizer & Depanner 6 
Hose Assembly Pool 15 
Setup Production Coordinator 1 
EM 4 
ME 6 
Janitors 3 
Facility Operators 3 
Warehouse person 1
