("AEES" or "Company") in November. Pursuant to the requirements of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act(the "WARN Act"), the Company herby notifies you and the State of Michigan that the date we expected the reductions in force to commence has been postponed from the two-week period beginning January 15, 2010 and ending January 29, 2010 to the two-week period beginning February 12, 2010 and ending February 26, 2010. The reason for this postponement is that there has been a temporary increase in customer orders recently that require the Company to continue production past the original dates of the layoffs. By providing this notice, the Company does not concede or admit that the WARN Act applies, or that this notice or the November Notice is otherwise required. All other provisions of the November Notice remain in effect. Should you require further information regarding the planned reductions in force, you may contact me at 269-668-3397 Ext. 314. RECEIVEDIN
