RE : Deaconess Hospital: Cincinnati, Ohio --Significant Employee Reduction Dear Mr. Turner: This notice is being provided to you on December 2, 2009 pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, which requires employers to give official notice to certain government units or officials of a pending facility shutdown or significant staffing reduction. Deaconess Hospital (located at 311 Straight Street, Cincinnati OH 45219) will be restructuring and therefore significantly reducing its employee headcount. Position eliminations will begin on January 31, 2010 and are expected to be completed by 
February 14, 2010 (2 weeks later). The plan is to eliminate a total of 105 positions at this 
time -all of which will be permanent. Attached Exhibit A is a list of affected positions 
and the number of employees holding each position as of the date of this letter. 
Please contact me with any questions . Sincerely , J:v1>/Jc_r1~ ctJ U,rk_} Allison Hutchins Human Resources Department 513-559--2244 REGULAR STAFF JOBS ACCOUNTANT 1 ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT 1 ASSOCIATE NURSE MANAGER 2 ASSOCIATE NURSE MANAGER PACU 1 ASSOCIATE NURSE MANAGER SURGERY 1 CARDIOVASCULAR TECHNOLOGIST 1 CASE MANAGER .RN-QRC 3 CENTRAL PROCESSING TECHNICIAN 2 CENTRAL PROCESSING TECHNICIAN II 1 CERTIFIED THERAPIST RECREATION SPECIALIST 2 CHARGE NURSE ARTHRITIS 1 CHIEF CT TECHNOLOGIST 1 CHIEF NUCLEAR MEDICINE TECHNOLOGIST 1 CHIEF RADIOLOGY TECHNICIAN ULTRASOUND 1 CLERK RADIOLOGY 2 CLINICAL ASSISTANT 1 CLINICAL CHARGE AUDITOR 1 CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER 1 CONTROL CLERK 1 CONTROLLER 1 COORDINATOR CENTRAL SUPPLY 1 CORRESPONDENCE CLERK 1 CT TECHNOLOGIST 2 CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE LAB 1 DIAGNOSTIC CLERK 1 DIRECTOR & CHIEF NURSING OFFICER 1 DIRECTOR LAB 1 DIRECTOR MARKETING 1 DIRECTOR RADIOLOGY 1 DIRECTOR SURGICAL SERVICES RN 1 DRIVER CLERK LAB 1 ECHO TECHNOLOGIST 2 ER TECHNICIAN-TRIAGE 2 FINANCIAL ANALYST 1 HUMAN RESOURCES ASSISTANT 1 HUMAN RESOURCES SPECIALIST 1 IS SUPPORT TECHNICIAN 1 LAB ASSIST ANT 1 LEAD PHYSICAL THERAPIST 1 LEAD SCHEDULER 1 LPN 6 MANAGER BILLING 1 MARKETING SYSTEMS ASST 1 MATERIAL SERVICES TECHNICIAN 1 MATERIALS SERVICE GENERALIST 1 MEDICAL RECORDS TECHNICIAN RECEPTIONIST 2 MEDICAL TRANSCRIPTION 1 MEDICAL TRANSCRIPTION 1ST II 1 MONITOR WATCHER 3 MRI TECHNOLOGIST 2 NUCLEAR MED TECHNOLOGIST 1 NURSE DIRECTOR 1 NURSE EDUCATOR 1 PATIENT ACCOUNTANT SPECIALIST 2 PATIENT CARE ASSISTANT 12 PATIENT CARE NIGHT SUPERVISOR 4 PATIENTCARESUPPORTTECHNICIAN 1 PAYROLL SUPERVISOR 1 PHARMACIST 3 PHARMACY TECHNICIAN 5 PHLEBOTOMIST 6 PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSISTANT 1 PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN 2 QRMSPECIALIST 1 RADIOLOGY ASSIST ANT 1 RADIOLOGY TECHNICIAN MAMMOGRAPHY 1 RADIOLOGY TECHNICIAN SPECIAL PROCEDURES 3 RADIOLOGY TECHNOLOGIST 5 RECEPTIONIST ARTHRITIS 1 RECEPTIONIST CLERK PHYSICAL THERAPY 1 REGISTERED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIST 9 REGISTRAR-PRECERTIFICATION COORDINATOR 1 REGISTRATION CLERK 8 RES Pl RA TORY THERAPIST REGISTERED 6 RESPIRATORY THERAPY TECHNICIAN CERTIFIED 3 RN 38 RN CATHETERIZA TION LAB 2 RN EMERGENCY ROOM 7 RN ONCOLOGY 2 RN PACU 2 RN SPECIALIST AREA 1 SCHEDULING SPECIALIST 1 SR ACCOUNTANT 1 STAFFING SPECIALIST-PCS 1 SUPERVISOR RADIOLOGY 1 SUPERVISOR ADMISSIONS 1 SUPERVISOR LAB MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 3 SUPERVISOR, CUSTOMER RELATIONS 1 , SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS MGR 1 SURGICAL ASSISTANT 3 SURGICAL ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR/SPV 1 SURGICALCARDIAC RN 10 SURGICAL SCHEDULING SECRETARY 1 SURGICAL TECHNOLOGIST 4 SYSTEM ANALYST 1 TELEPHONE OPERATOR 7 UNIT CLERK 8 VASCULAR ULTRASOUND TECHNICIAN 1 PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT COORDINATOR 1 ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT I 1 PHP EMPLOYEES DRIVER CLERK 1 THERAPIST I 2 OFFICE CLERK-MENTAL HEAL TH -1 PROGRAM LEADER PSYCHIATRIC NURSE 1 Total 253
