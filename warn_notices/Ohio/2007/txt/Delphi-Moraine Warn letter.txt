Dear Mr. Turner: This notice is being provided to you pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act of 1988, which requires employers to give official notice of pending plant closings to certain government units and government officials. Delphi Corporation and the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers-Communications Workers of America (IUE-CW A), are currently engaged in negotiations on several issues, including the winddown of Delphi's Moraine facility located at 3535 Kettering Boulevard, Moraine, Ohio. While the parties are continuing to work towards a consensual resolution concerning this closure and its impact upon our employees, it is Delphi's intent that the Moraine facility will be closed commencing in early-to mid-October 2007, and that permanent layoffs of existing employees within the meaning of the Act would begin in early October and continue into November. It is anticipated that all positions at the facility would be eliminated in connection with any closure, which would impact approximately 40 salaried and 275 hourly employees currently employed at the facility. A list of the affected positions and numbers of employees in each position is attached. Some of the affected employees are represented by IUE-CWA Local 801, which is located at 1250 West Dorothy Lane, Kettering, Ohio, and whose chief elected officer is Mark Profitt. We appreciate whatever help you may provide to assist in making this transition as smooth as possible for the affected employees. If you have any questions or would like any further information, please feel free to contact Human Resources Manager Terry Mack at 937-395.3314. Sincerely, ?t £~ Terry~k
