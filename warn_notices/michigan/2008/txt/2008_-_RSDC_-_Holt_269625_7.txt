OF MICHIGAN January 25, 2008 Deborah Hennessey Workforce Transition Division, Rapid Response Section Bureau of Workforce Programs Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Growth 201 North Washington Square, 5th Floor Lansing, MI 48913 RE: ADVANCE NOTICE OF EMPLOYMENT LOSS RSDC of Michigan, LLC (RSDC) is providing advance notice of an employment loss that may qualify as a mass layoff for the purposes of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 USC 2101 et seq. (WARN). As of the date of this notice, RSDC does not expect that the employment losses at issue will affect the minimum number of employees to specifically trigger the requirements of Section 2 of WARN, 29 USC 2102. Thus, while RSDC does not believe this notice is legally required at present, it seeks to provide good-faith, advance notice of the following:  NAME AND ADDRESS OF EMPLOYMENT  SITE  WHERE  EMPLOYMENT  LOSS  WILL TAKE PLACE  RSDC of Michigan LLC  1775 Holloway Drive  Holt, MI 48842  NAMEffELEPHONE NUMBER FURTHER INFORMATION  OF  COMPANY  OFFICIAL  TO CONTACT FORRECEIVED  Cheryl Hayes  Human Resources Manager 517-699-7732  JAN 3 0 2008  EXPECTED DATE OF FIRST SEPARATIONS  RAPIDRESPONSE  WORKFORCEPROGRAMS  We expect the first separations to occur within the first two weeks of April, 2008 based on the schedule that GM has provided us.
