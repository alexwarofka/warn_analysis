Beckhorn: Hostess Brands, Inc. (including its affiliate Interstate Brands Corporation, "Hostess" or the "Company") filed for chapter 11 relief on January 11, 2012 (the "Filing"). The Company has been actively engaged in discussions with various lenders and potential purchasers regarding Hostess' restructuring both before and after the Filing. Our primary focus is to complete our restructuring of the Company and emerge from chapter 1l as a viable company. However, it is possible that, despite our best efforts, certain events may occur that would require Hostess to sell all or portions of its business and/ or wind down its operations and liquidate. Despite the uncertainty of what may happen, the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification .Act and certain related State statutes (collectively, "\'{I.ARN") generally require employers to provide advance notice in the event of certain covered employment actions. To comply with any \'{!ARN obligations Hostess may have, this letter is intended to give you conditional notice that, based upon the best information reasonably available to Hostess at this time, it is possible that one of the following events may occur: ¥ 	The board of directors authmizes, or seeks court authorization for, the pursuit of a sale of all or a 
substantial portion of all of Hostess' assets; 
¥ 	The board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authmization for, Hostess to stop pursuing the 
restructuring of its business; 
¥ 	More than 2oryoof Hostess' aggregate workforce is laid off after January 11, 2012; ¥ 	Hostess receives an unsatisfactory resolution of its pending motion before the bankruptcy court regarding certain modifications to its collective bargaining agreements with the Bakers and/or the Teamsters; 6031 Connection Drive, Irving, TX 75039 -(972) 532-4500 ¥ 	There is a strike, ,valkout, lockout, slo,vdo,vn or other ,vork stoppage that is likely to have a tnaterial adverse effect on I-Iostess; or ¥ 	1--lostcss seeks bankruptcy court approval to con1n1ence a sale of property ,vhile in bankiáuptcy ,vhich accounts for 1norc than 20o/o of Hostess' consolidated net sales as reported on Hostess' financial state1nents for the t\velve-111onth period preccdingJanua1áy 11, 2012. If one of these events occurs, 1-Iostess 111ay begin the process of per1nanently ceasing operations, and significantly scaling down operations at its Troy 1'!I -33801 Dcquindre located at 33801 Dequindre, Troy, lv!I 48083-4631, as early as 60 days fron1 the receipt of this notice.

At the end of this process, the entire Troy i'vIT -33801 Dequindre ,vould be per1nanently closed.
