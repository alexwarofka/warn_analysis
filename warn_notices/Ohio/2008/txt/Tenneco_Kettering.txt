Kettering Operations NOTICE 
To:  Wendy Patton, Rapid Response Program Administrator Office of Workforce Development Ohio Department of Job and Family Services P.O. Box 1618, Columbus, Ohio 43216-1618  From:  Terry Youngerman Tenneco  Human Resource Manager 2555 Woodman Drive  Kettering, Ohio 45420 Date: December 12, 2008 Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"), we regret to inform you that Tenneco will have a permanent layoff of employees at its Kettering, Ohio facility located at 2555 Woodman Drive Kettering, Ohio 45420. This action is due to schedule reductions from our customer General Motors (GM). Currently the Kettering plant provides product to six GM facilities. Those assembly plants are Hamtramck, Fairfax, Orion, Lordstown, Ramos and Oshawa On November 17, 2008 GM formally notified us of schedule reductions at four of those assembly plants. Due to these schedule reductions we permanently laid off27 employees effective December 1, 2008. Subsequently, on December 8, 2008 we were again notified by GM of dramatic, unforeseeable and additional schedule reductions, line rate reductions and temporary plant closings at all of the assembly plants that we service. These reductions have essentially cut our daily production requirements almost in half, from around 17,100 units per day to around 8,814 units per day. This reduction in schedule has caused us to review our resource allocation and announce another permanent layoff of 91 hourly production workers effective January 5, 2009. This action is expected to be permanent in nature. While the Company acknowledges that, in normal circumstances, sixty (60) days' advance notice may be required under the federal WARN law for certain employment actions, the Company could not provide such notjce that far in advance due to the unforeseeable business circumstances regarding the unanticipated and dramatic major downturn in the national economy and the above-described sudden, unforeseeable and significant schedule reductions from our customer General Motors which has affected our business. In summary, from December I, 2008 through January 5, 2009 we will have permanently laid off 118 hourly employees. DEC-15-2008 09:29 TENNECO The number of workers who hold affected jobs in each job classification, the job titles of the affected positions, and schedule of separations are as shown on Exhibit "A" which is attached and made a part of this notice. Exhibit "A" Permanent
