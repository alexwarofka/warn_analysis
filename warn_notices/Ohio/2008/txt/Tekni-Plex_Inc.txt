(together with its subsidiaries, the "Company") operates the Swan Hose manufacturing facility at 201 E. Beal Avenue, Bucyrus, OH 44820. On March 10, 2008, the Company recalled all eligible employees from layoff and also hired new employees to fill current business needs at the Bucyrus plant. Although the Company would prefer to maintain consistent employment levels at all of its facilities, fluctuations in business conditions and seasonal demand for garden hoses make it virtually impossible for us to maintain steady employment levels at the Bucyrus plant. Unless current demand levels for the products we produce at Bucyrus are sustained indefinitely, the Company will have no alternative but to have another reduction in force. We want to give our employees advance notice that layoffs may become necessary. We currently expect layoffs at the Bucyrus facility to occur on or about May 31, 2008. The job titles and number of the affected employees are listed below: Job Title Number of Affected Employees Core & Jacket Extruder Operators 9 Knitters 6 Hose Assembly Pool 33 Extra Person 3 Reclaim Lab Tech 3 Reclaim Plastic Compounder 6 Chopper 12 Pelletizer Operator 15 Shipping Receiving Clerk 1 Gatherer 1 Laborer 1 Receiving Warehouse 1 ME 5 Swan е 201 E.
