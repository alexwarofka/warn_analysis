Washington Square Lansing, Ml 48913  Re:  JOHNSON CONTROLS, INC.-MASS NOTICE DUE TO UNFORESEEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES  LAYOFF REVISED BUSINESS  Dear Ms. Hennessey: As indicated in my previous letter of October 24, 2008, on or about December 24, 2008, Johnson Controls, Inc. was scheduled to permanently layoff a number of its employees at its facility located at 20201 Woodruff Road, Rockwood, Michigan 48173. Consistent with those plans, the last day of employment for the affected employees was anticipated to be December 23, 2008, or within two weeks thereafter. Due to unforeseeable business circumstances, the affected employees that are represented and were scheduled to be laid off on December 24, 2008, will be permanenVy laid off immediately. Chrysler originally informed Johnson Controls, Inc. that it would eliminate its second shift on December 31, 2008. However, Chrysler informed Johnson Controls, Inc. yesterday that ~s second shift will not return before December 31, 2008. Unfortunately, Chrysler's action was outside of Johnson Controls, lnc.'s control and not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial notice. Thus. Johnson Controls, Inc. must accelerate ~planned layoffs and is unable to give sixty (60) days advance notice of this new layoff date. A list of the affected job classifications and number of employees per classification is attached. All of these employees are represented by the UAW Local 3000. Union inquiries should be directed to Tom Spears, President, UAW Local 3000, 22693 Van Horn Road, Trenton, Michigan 48183, or via telephone at (734) 692-3490. Please note that the unrepresented employees that were originally scheduled to be laid off on December 24, 2008, will no longer be laid off on that date. All terminated employees will be paid all earned wages and agreed-upon fringe benefits upon termination. The layoffs will be permanent and limited bumping rights will exist for represented employees. For further information regarding this matter, please contact me at Johnson Controls, Inc., 20201 Woodruff Road, Rockwood, Michigan 48173, or via telephone at (734) 783-7750 or (734) 231.8259. ~)ce'.ely, _ tA,f,J,i,,u11-UA<t"r,~ Lisa M.
