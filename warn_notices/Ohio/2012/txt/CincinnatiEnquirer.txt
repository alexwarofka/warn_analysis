Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216 Dear Ms. Maybriar: We write to inform you that The Cincinnati Enquirer (the "Company") will be shutting down its entire facility located at 1531 Western Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45214. This shutdown will affect all employees working at the facility and is expected to be permanent. At this time, we anticipate that affected employees will have their employment terminate on October 8, 2012 or sometime during a 14-day period thereafter. On January 8, 2012, the Company sent written notifications to affected union-represented employees. Prior to that notification, the Company negotiated severance terms with their union representatives. The severance terms include severance pay which employees were given the option of receiving as a lump sum without benefits continuation or as salary continuation with on-going benefits. The severance terms include outplacement and training through Gateway Community and Technical College or Cincinnati State Technical and Community College. A list of union representatives accompanies this letter as Attachment A. On April 12, 2012, the Company sent written notifications to affected non-union employees. These employees will receive severance pay in the form of salary continuation and benefits. Affected employees will not have any right to bump or displace other employees working for the Company. Approximately 217 employees will be affected by the closure. A list of job titles and the number of employees currently holding affected positions accompanies this letter as Attachment B. This announcement and the above timetable are based upon the information currently available. We will inform you of any changes in these plans or if additional information becomes available. e.2r«Bil@lili&ili@in
