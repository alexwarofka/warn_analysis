Re: WARN Notice Dear Mr. Conway: Last month, Whirlpool Corporation announced the permanent closing of the Whirlpool, Benton Harbor Division as part of an ongoing restructuring of manufacturing operations. We are required by the Workers' Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN") to provide you with this notice within 60 days of the first terminations caused by this closing. Terminations will commence on or about August 27, 2010 and continue until January 28, 2011. These reductions will be permanent and there will be no bumping rights. We anticipate that the closing will ultimately impact a total of 216 employees at this location. The Company is providing employees with information and a package of transition benefits. Should you have any questions, please contact Steven Morris, Manager, Human Resources at our location. Steven's direct telephone number is 269-923-0301. Please note: this notice applies for separations that are likely to occur on October 29, 2010. A notice for separations anticipated for August 27, 2010 and October 1,20010 had been previously sent to you. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding. Best regards, RECEIVED IN 9;,C\,l-'4--.:--u SEP O I 2010 Jim Spicer Plant Manager RAPIDRESPONSE Attachments: Separations 10/29/2010 Vlanpower Reduction--Benton Harbor Division October 29, 2010
