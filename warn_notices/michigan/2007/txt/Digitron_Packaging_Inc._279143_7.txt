Digitron has been negotiating with the Ford Motor Company to restructure its supplier contract. If Ford was notified that Digitron was about to cease operations, Ford would terminate its relationship with Digitron. Moreover. on May 4, 2007, despite being actively engaged in negotiations concerning the payment of utilities, Digitron's landlord shut off power to the plant, precipitating the termination of negotiations with Ford concerning continued operations. Digitron is now in the process of winding down and closing the business. Thank you for your cooperation.
