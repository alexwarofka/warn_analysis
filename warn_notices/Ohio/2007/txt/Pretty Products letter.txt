Dear Governmental Officials: This notice is being provided to you pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification ("WARN") Act of 1988, which requires employers to give official notice of pending plant closings or mass layoffs to certain governmental units and governmental officials. Pretty Products, LLC will reduce and ultimately cease its production operations at the Coshocton facilities located at 437 Cambridge Road and 592 Clow Lane, ' 	Coshocton, OH 43812 over the next six to eight months on what the Company expects to be a permanent basis. This decision will ultimately impact approximately 15 salaried employees and 245 hourly employees currently employed at the facilities. We also anticipate that the Company's non-production administrative positions will remain in Coshocton for the indefinite future. Presently, we anticipate that the first employment separations will begin on December 1, 2007 or within 14 days thereafter. It is anticipated that the layoffs will be completed by February 29, 2008. The separations of the union and non-union production employee, when finalized, will be permanent and will ultimately result in the elimination of all production operations at the Coshocton facilities. We will be providing you with a more detailed schedule for the separation of employees as soon as we can finalize the plans for the shutdown of production operations. Two collective bargaining units represent employees at Pretty Products, LLC; Local Union No. SOL, United Steel, Paper And Forestry, Rubber Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial And Service Workers International Union, Steelworkers, AFL-CIO-CLC ("Local SOL") and Local Union No. 18-S, International Union of Operating Engineers ("Local 18.S") ( collectively referred to as "Unions").
