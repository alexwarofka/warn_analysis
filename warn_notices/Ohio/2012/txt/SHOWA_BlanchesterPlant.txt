Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216-1618 DELIVERED VIA EMAIL at JeanAnn.Carlson@jfs.ohio.gov RE: Voluntary WARN Act Notice Dear Ms. Carlson: Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. 2102, et.seq., please consider this letter as a voluntary notice that American Showa, Inc. (ASI) will be laying off approximately 107 associates at our Blanchester Plant effective August 24, 2012. In addition, there will be approximately 66 temporary associates who will be impacted by the reduction on August 24th_ Although this layoff does not require a WARN notice per the requirements of the WARN act, it is ASl's practice to provide such a notice on a voluntary basis whenever possible. The Blanchester Plant produces power steering units for the automotive industry. Beginning with the 2013 models, most customers are changing the technology from hydraulic power steering to electric power steering. This change in technology greatly changes the manufacturing processes required to produce the parts, and the Blanchester plant is not equipped to meet the requirements of the new technology. Accordingly, production at the Blanchester Plant will be greatly reduced. The reduction in production will result in a loss of 157 hourly production positions, including 66 positions that are being held by temporary associates employed by Adecco and placed at the Blanchester Plant. In addition, there will be 8 hourly technician positions, 5 hourly supervisor positions, 2 salaried specialist positions and 1 manager position eliminated. This reduction in force is expected to be indefinite. However, in accordance with our company policy regarding a reduction in force, the hourly associates will have recall rights for one year. Ifyou have any questions regarding this matter, please contact me at 614-579-8753. Best Regards, ~1\~ ~BJ-LoAnn Quinn Burt Administration General Manager
