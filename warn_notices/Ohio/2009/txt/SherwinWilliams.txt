SHERWIN"'WILLIAMS. ,,i Paint & Coatings Division July 20, 2009 Rapid Response Section Bureau of WIA Ohio Department of Job & Family Services P.O. Box 1618 Columbus, OH 43216-1618 To Whom It May Concern: I regret to inform you that the Paint & Coatings Division of the Sherwin-Williams Company has announced that it plans to permanently close the Deshler Facility located at 299 Chestnut Street, Deshler, OH 43516 sometime during the fourth quarter of 2009. As a result of this permanent shutdown, 121 employees will be permanently laid off. Enclosed, as Exhibit A is a list of the job titles that will be affected, the number of affected employees in each job classification and the names of employees currently in these positions. These employees do not have the right to displace other employees when they are laid off. In the view of the fact that layoffs will subsequently be implemented as production ceases, and the precise dates for the same are not known at this time, we are not able to give you a definitive separation schedule. However, the Paint & Coatings Division anticipates that unless circumstances change, the separations will be scheduled to take place during September and October 2009. As indicated above, this schedule may change, in the Company's sole discretion, as needs may dictate. For your information, there are no unions representing these affected employees. If you wish to have additional information concerning the foregoing, please contact Bill Diemert at (419) 278-8300 x214. Sincerely, Bill Diemert Plant Manager
