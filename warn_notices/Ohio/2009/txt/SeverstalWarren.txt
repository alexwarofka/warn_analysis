Via Certifred Mail Return Receipt Requested May7,2009 Mr. Jim Turner Chief, Rapid Response Section Ohio Department of Job and Family Services 4020 E. 5th A venue Columbus, OH 43219 RE: Notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN'') Dear Mr. Turner: This letter is to advise you in accordance with the provisions of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"), that Severstal Warren, Inc. (the "Company"), located at 999 Pine Avenue, SE, Warren, OH 44483"6525, is extending its current layoffs at the Warren. Ohio facility for an extended period of time and temporarily idling its Warren, Ohio facility. Originally, the Company had believed that the layoffs that commenced during the last few months of 2008 and continuing into early 2009, were short term in nature and our business plan expected to return the laid off workers to active employment by the end of March 2009. However, as you are probably aware our business position continues to deteriorate and orders are not returning to sufficient levels to return the plant to any level of meaningful production. Over the last 3 to 4 months, Severstal has been attempting to obtain new orders to replace the abrupt loss of previously booked orders. Unfortunately, the current economic climate and dramatic recessionary forecasts, coupled with the significant erosion in pricing which has developed over the last few weeks, have caused us to be unable to receive orders to prevent the temporary shutdown of the Warren facility. The prior layoffs at the Warren facility have affected production and maintenance workers represented by the United Steelworkers of America, the I.U. of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers, as well as nonunion (salaried) workers at the facility. Additional layoffs of those USWA and Bricklayer members and salaried employees currently working are expected over the next 60 to 90 days. Attached hereto as Attachment 1 is a list of the job titles of the positions which are currently on layoff and Attachment 2 which is a list of the job titles of the positions which will be affected by the additional layoffs and shutdown of the facility. Under the parties' current collective bargaining agreement, the individuals represented by the USWA and Bricklayers whose job positions are listed on the attached summaries, may not be the actual employees laid off due to bumping and seniority rights within the bargaining unit if any bargaining unit employees are retained to maintain the facility in an idled state. While the Company anticipates that it will restart the facility when orders return to more historical levels, some salaried employees affected by this cessation of business were permanently separated as the Company continues to look for ways to reduce costs and become competitive in a changed marketplace. Salaried employees will be notified by separate letter informing them of their status with the Company. In order to finish current workin progress and satisfy customer demands, the shutdown will occur through staggered layoffs. Layoffs of the currently working employees are anticipatedto occur within 14 days of the layoff dates specified in the following schedule:  Date  Employees Affected  May 7, 2009  84.5 % of workforce  June 1, 2009  91.0 % of workforce  By June 1, 2009 the entire facility will be shut down and idled, and all work will cease at the facility until orders are sufficient to recommence work at the facility. The Company official to contact for further information about this matter is Michael Lewandowski, General Manager Human Resources, Severstal Warren, Inc.Mr. Lewandowski's phone number is 330á841á8231. Very truly yours, Gregory L.
