Re: WARN Notice of Plant Closing and/or Mass Layoff To Whom It May Concern: This notice is being provided pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, which requires employers to give official notice to affected employees and the ODJFS of a pending plant closing or mass layoff, as defined by the Act, at our Hudson, Ohio facility. This closing may rise to the level necessary to trigger WARN Act notice. First Student is providing this advance, written notice to, among other things, assist the ODJFS in preparing for the upcoming transition. These layoffs resulting from this closing are expected to be permanent, and the entire facility is expected to be closed. Another school bus contractor has been selected to provide transportation services. First Student received notice on April 26, 2010 that the Hudson City School District has decided not to award the company any routes for the 2010-2011 school year. The loss of this contract effectively ends our business interests in Hudson. As a result of these sudden, unforeseen business circumstances, First Student expects its operations located at 91 Owen Brown Street, Hudson, OH 44236 to experience a permanent closing. It is anticipated that the closing will occur on approximately June 30, 2010. Another school bus contractor, Petermann School Bus Service, has been selected to provide transportation services for this district. As many as 80 employees may be subjected to a layoff. However, it is probable that First Student will have 
transfer opportunities available for some employees at other facilities, and Petermann School Bus Service will 
likely have employment opportunities for many of the displaced First Student employees.
