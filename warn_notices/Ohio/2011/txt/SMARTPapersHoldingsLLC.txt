RE: Smart Papers Holdings LLC, Hamilton, Ohio Dear Ohio Dislocation Worker Unit: This notice is to inform you that SMART Papers Holdings LLC may be closing its 60 I North B Street, Hamilton Ohio operations and laying off its employees. On October 20, 2011 SMART Papers provided a WARN notice indicating expected lay off dates were based upon three groups with Group I occurring from December 19 and 30, 2011, Group II occurring from January 10-24, 2012, and Group III occurring from February 15-29, 2012. Originally we advised that the timing of the layoffs are dependent upon the volume of customer orders during the wind down period and such layoffs are expected to be permanent. Based upon the orders we have received since the announcement made in October, it is necessary to change the lay off period for most of those employees originally identified in Group I and Group II of the original WARN notification dated October 20, 2011. The US economic slowdown has intensified the effects of reduced commercial demand and the rapid expansion of low-priced Asian coated paper manufacturing, the increased costs of raw materials and chemicals, and the uncertainty on cost requirements of pending EPA legislation have all contributed to the decision to closing the facility. SMART Papers will lay off those employees highlighted in Attachment I as originally indicated in the October 20, 2011 notification and one othe will be extended from the original December 19-30, 2011 date to an amended lay off date of January 13, 2012. The remainder of the employees in Attachment I show a revised lay off period commencing on February 15, 2012 and ending on February 29, 2012. The exact timing of the layoffs will be dependent on a number of factors which includes the production and shipping schedules . We will keep you apprised of any anticipated changes . Bargaining Unit employees covered under the current l~bor agreement with USW, Local 1967 have certain bumping rights. The name of the local union official representing the bargaining unit employees at Smart Papers is Paul Houston, President, and his contact information is US W, Local 1967, I 050 Millville Avenue, Hamilton, Ohio 45013, telephone number 513-868-8417 and cell number 513-310-7104. Attached please find a list of the job titles of positions (Attachments I) affected and the number of affected employees in each job classification . For more information , please contact Susan D. Carpenter , Director of Human Resources at 513.869.5237 (cell# 513.460.0652) or susan.carpenter@smartpapers.com. e(гj rewHo~ EO V' Attachment FACSIMILE & CERTIFIED MAIL ATTACHMENT I Original Warn Date Revised Warn Date Last Name First Name Middle Name Job title Base Amount (annual) Date From Date To New Date From Originally Identified as Group I in October 20, 2011 Notification Payroll Administrato r 12/19/2011 12/30/2011 2/15/2012 Stores Supervisor 12/19/2011 12/30/2011 2/15/2012 Prqduct Dev ,Assoc 12/.lQ/_1__
