To Whom it May Concem: 8800 Detroit, located at 880 W Long lake Rd., Troy, Mt 48098, is expected to close and terminate its entire workforce. While an exact date has not yet been established for this closure, the majority of the terminations are expected to occur on January 29, 2010. While we expect the facility closing to be permanent, a group of employees may be requested to stay beyond January 29, 2010 to assist with the closing of the facility. We expect those remaining employees will be terminated no later than May 31, 2010. Notwithstanding the above, if any prospective business is obtained, the closing in its entirety may not occur, and a group of employees may be requested to stay beyond January 29, 2010 to service the new business. Any employee remaining employed beyond January 29, 2010 will receive at least 60 days advance notice of their specific termination dates if otherwise required by applicable law. "Bumping rights,'' which are inapplicable in this situation, do not exist and the affected employees are not covered under a collective bargaining agreement. The following is a list of job titles of positions to be affected, and the number of affected employees in each job classification in the company: TERMINATIONDATE OF JANUARY 29. 2010 Brand Account Services ' ' 'TITLE  COUNT  i ACCOUNTEXECUTIVE  2  ACCOUNTSUPERVISOR  7  ACCT DIR.
