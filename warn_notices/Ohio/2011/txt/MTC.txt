Mass Layoff -WARN Notice To Whom it May Concern: This notice is being provided pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (WARN), which requires employers to give official notice to certain government units or officials of a pending mass layoff or facility shut down. Please be advised that, Management & Training Corporation and MTC Medical ( collectively "MTC") will permanently layoff its employees who are employed at the following facilities: Lake Erie Correctional Facility, 501 Thompson Road, PO Box 8000, Conneaut, OH 44030-8000, and North Coast Correctional Treatment Facility, 2000 South Avon-Belden Road, Grafton, OH 44044. The Ohio Department of Corrections has awarded contracts to operate these facilities to other contractors. As a result, all of the employees at those facilities will be permanently laid off by MTC effective December 31, 2011. Based on the best information currently available to us, the closure will result in the layoff of approximately 271 employees at Lake Erie Correctional Facility, and approximately 175 employees at North Coast Correctional Treatment Facility. The job titles and number of employees in each who will be affected is attached. Correctional Officers at Lake Erie Correctional Institution are represented by the Security, Police, Fire and Professionals Association, Local Union 60. To MTC's knowledge, the highest ranking official of Local 60 is Mr. Jolm Jones. Mr. Jones is copied on this letter. The represented employees do not have any bumping rights as all members of the bargaining unit are being laid off, nor do they have any rights to reassignment to other jobs within MTC. You may contact me for additional information at (801) 693-2603 or by mail at: Management & Training Corporation 500 N.
