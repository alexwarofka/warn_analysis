Re: The Chardon Rubber Company Dear Sir or Madam: ·. ·· · This notice is being issued pursuant to the Worker Adjustment & Retraining Notification _,\ct of 1988 (the "W AR.i'\JAct"). In connection with the filing of a.petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in May 2009, Chardon Rubber Company (the "Company"} entered into an asset purchase · agreement with Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Company (the "Buyer") under which the Company is selling certain of its assets to Buyer (the "Sale"). As part of the Sale, the Company will provide services to Buyer, including the manufacture of certain products, under a Management Services Agreement (the "MSA"), for a period of four (4) months from the effective date of the MSA (the "MSA Term"). During the MSA Term, Buyer has the right to remove from the premises of the Company's facility located at 373 Washington Street, Chardon, Ohio 44024 (tb.e "Facili·y") the eqvipment it purchases as part of the Sale . We have been informed that Buyer intends to remove the compression and injection molding lines of business from the Facility. By issuing this notice , the Company does not concede that the WARN Act applies to this situation; we issue this notice so that affected employees may begin to consider plans and options. Pursuant to the notification requirements of the WARN Act , to the extent that law even applies to the personnel actions described in this letter, the Company hereby grants your office notice that as a result of the removal of the compression and injection molding lines o(b~si1~~s. during a fourteen day penod beginning on or about September 1, 2009, a "mass layoff' as defined by the \\l ARN Act will occur at the Facility. This notice of mass layoff is conditioned upon the removal of the compression and injection molding lines of business by Buyer; when Buyer removes that equipment, then the Company will lay off fourteen employees. (00591060 DOC;! I The number of employees laid off as a result of the removal of the compression and injection molding lines of business will not, by itself, constitute a mass layoff for purposes of the WARN Act. At present, we do not anticipate that a sufficient number of additional personnel will be laid off over the next ninety days so that in the aggregate, fifty or more employees at the Facility suffer an employment loss during the next ninety days. Nonetheless, in order to provide any WARN notices which subsequent events might require, the Company now issues this notice. As a result of the removal of the compression and injection molding lines of business, the Company plans to lay off employees in the following job classifications: This lay off is expected to be permanent. Bumping rights exist for the bargaining unit personnel under the collective bargaining agreement, as amended by the Facility Shutdown Agreement. Bargaining unit personnel are represented by the United Steelworkers Local No. 557L, whose President is John Green, P. 0. Box 234, Chardon, Ohio 44024.
