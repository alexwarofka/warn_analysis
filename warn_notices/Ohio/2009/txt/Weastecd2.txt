We met with the respective mayors of Hillsboro and Greenfield on March 16, 2009. This consolidation is to involve moving the manufacturing operations from Greenfield to Hillsboro and shutdown two of the manufacturing lines in Hillsboro. The resultant headcount when fully completed will be approximately 145 associates. The original plan involved the two Hillsboro lines, at our customers' request, being removed back to South Korea and Japan during the months of June and July. It appears now that the line removal will not occur until sometime in October to December. Therefore, as it appears today, any further large reduction will not occur until this fall. Our headcount wiU remain relatively constant until those two lines move out. I have included our monthly activity of reductions of at least six months or more to this point since June, 2008. Please note that the locations listed in the second column are: WHO -Hillsboro, OH facility WGO -Greenfield, OH facility WSO -	Seaman, OH facility, now closed as of Sept., 2008 Thank you for your time and attention and if you have questions, you may contact me at the phone number listed on the Notice of Closing. Bill Smith 1600 North High Street 	Hillsboro.
