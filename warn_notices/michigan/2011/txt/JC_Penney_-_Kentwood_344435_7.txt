Since plans call for the permanent closing of the entire Call Center, all 365 Associates will be affected. The closing will cause the permanent separation of Associates on or around April 2, 2011. This will include all Associates assigned to the Call Center, except those, if any, who remain with the Company in another location. Based on business needs and Associates' interests, it is anticipated that a few Associates may be offered employment in other JCPenney locations. JCPenney 6501 Legacy Drive Plano, TX 75024 WARN Notice Letter January 31, 2011 Page 2 The Associates in the Call Center do not have any bumping rights 1 with respect to positions in other JCPenney locations and are not represented by a union.
