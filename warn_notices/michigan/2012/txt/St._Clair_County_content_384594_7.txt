Ho\vever, it is possible that, despite our best efforts, certain events 1nay occur that ,vould require Hostess to sell all or portions of its business and/ or ,vind do,vn its operations and liquidate. Despite the uncertainty of,vhat n1ay happen, the federal \\larker Adjusttnent and ltetraining Notification Act and certain related State statutes (collectively, "\\! AllN") generally require e1nployers to provide advance notice in the event of certain covered cn1ploy1nent actions. To coinply,vith any \\!ARN obligations Hostess n1ay have, this letter is intended to give you conditional notice that, based upon the best inforn1ation reasonably available to Hostess at this titne, it is possible that one of the follo,ving events 1nay occur: ¥ 	'l'he board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, the pursuit of a sale of all or a substantial portion of all of Hostess' assets; ¥ 	'l'he board of directors authorizes, or seeks court authorization for, Hostess to stop pursuing the rcst11.1cturing of its busi11ess; ¥ 	l'-.Tore than 20¡/~ of Hostess' aggregate ,vorkforce is laid off after January 11, 2012; ¥ 	fiostcss receives an unsatisfactory resolution of its pending rnotion before the bankruptcy court regarding ccrtain 1nodifications to its collective bargaining agreen1ents ,vi.th the Bakers and/or the Tea1nsters; ¥ 	There is a strike, ,valkout, lockout, slo,vdo,vn or other ,vork stoppage that is likely to have a tnatcrial 6031 Connection Drive, Irving, TX 75039 -(972) 532á4500 adverse effect on Hostess; or ¥ 	Hostess seeks bankmptcy court approval to commence a sale of property while in bankruptcy which accounts for more than 20% of Hostess' consolidated net sales as reported on Hostess' financial statements for the twelve-month period precedingJanuru.y 11, 2012. If one of these events occurs, Hostess may begin the process of permanently ceasing operations, and significant!}' scaling down operations at its lVIa11rsville 1vII -808 Gratiot Bl located at 808 Gratiot Boulevard, :rvfarysville, l\H 48040-1127, as early as 60 days from the receipt of this notice.
