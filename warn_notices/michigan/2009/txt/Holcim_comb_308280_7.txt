Monroe Street Dundee, Michigan 48131 RE: CLOSURE OF HOLCIM (US) INC., DUNDEE, MICHIGAN FACILITY Dear Mr. O'Lone, In December 2008 and February 2009, I sent letters to you notifying you of Holcim's permanent shutdown of its Dundee, Michigan cement manufacturing facility located at 15215 Day Road, Dundee, Michigan 48131. In those letters I notified you that the closure would be conducted in three phases. The first phase was the shutdown of kiln 2 which occurred on November 30, 2008. The second phase was the shutdown of kiln 1 which occurred on March 14, 2009. The third phase of the shutdown will be the idling of the grinding mills which is now expected to occur on August 11, 2009. It has not been determined whether the shipping station will be shutdown at this time. As previously stated, the shutdown will affect 139 employees. The previous notices related to the separations that occurred on February 12, 2009 and April 15, 2009. We have now determined that the third separation related to the idling of the grinding mills will occur on August 11, 2009 and will affect approximately 33 total employees, 23 hourly employees and 10 salaried employees. A list of the employees we currently anticipate to be affected in the third separation is enclosed. Bumping rights exist in connection with this reduction for hourly employees. Our hourly employees are represented by the Cement, Lime, Gypsum and Allied Workers' Division of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers. Iron Shipbuilders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers. The chief elected officer is Newton B. Jones, International President, 753 State Avenue, Suite 570, Kansas City, Kansas, 66101. If you have any questions, the name and telephone number of a company official to contact for further information is: Melissa Gentner, Manager, Human Resources (734-529-4632). Very truly yours, RECEIVED
