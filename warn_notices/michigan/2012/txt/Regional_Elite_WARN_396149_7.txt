Notice of Station Closing 
Dear Ms. Beckhorn: This notice is provided in accordance with Section 450. 736 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. Regional Elite Airline Services LLC ("Regional Elite,,) located at MBS International Airport, 8500 Garfield Road Suite 101, Freeland, MI 48623 ("MBS") will be ceasing operations. Regional Elite is ceasing operations because the ground handling work we perform at MBS has been awarded to another contractor. Consequently, the entire Regional Elite station at MBS will permanently close and all employees in that station will be separated. This closing will commence on October 23, 2012, or within a 14-day period beginning on that date, which will also be the expected date of separation for all employees. Attachment A is a listing of job titles of positions affected by this closing and the number of employees so affected in each job title. Bumping rights do not exist for any terminated employees. None of the employees at this station are represented by a union. Regional Elite understands that the contractor who will be performing the work after our closure plans to offer employment to current Regional Elite employees working at MBS. Please contact me at 612-266-5203 if you need further information.
