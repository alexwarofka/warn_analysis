TOH-CREEKCARLTON CREEK IRONWOFlKS April 13, 2009 	RECEIVED Ms. Deborah Henne.~sey, Director Workforce Transition Unit APR 1 3 2009 Michigan Dept. of Career Development Workforce Programs RAPIDRESPONSEVictor Office Center -s•hFloor WORKFORCEPROGRAMS201 North Washington Square Lansing, Michigan 48913 RE: 	Conditional Notice of Mass Layoff Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN") DearMs. Hennessey, This conditional notice is being given to you under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN"). As you may be aware, Carlton Creek Ironworks has been in business in Rothbury, Michigan fur over 40 years. Like many employers, Carlton Creek has struggled with the current economic conditions. As a result of a downturn in orden;, the Company began temporarily laying off employees in the Fall of 2008 from its plant at 2625 W. Winston Road, Rothbury, Michigan and its corporate office at 80 l W. Norton Ave., Muskegon, Michigan. These employees were laid off with an expectation that they would be recalled within a few weeks or months. Despite significant effort on the Company's part to generate new business and restructure its existing orders to maintain production and headcount, the layoffs continued into Januaryof this year. In January Carlton Creek pulled forwardaJI customer releases scheduled for delivery in February and early March, producing them in January. Our plan was to complete that production, shut down the plant andlay off employees for three weeks in February (to conserve cash), ship product out of finished goods inventory (to satisfy customer demand), and allow new customer releases to be scheduled. Consistent with this plan, in Febroary of this year, we laid off all but 16 of our approl<imately 228 employees. As with the earlier layoffs, the February layoffs were done with the expectation that they were temporary and employees would be returned to work beginning in March as orders came due for production. Unfortunately, several ~ignificant orders were then unexpectedly and indcfmitcly delayed or canceJled, and we were unable to hring in enough new business to viably operate the plant. For example: 2625 W Winston Road Rothbury, Ml 49452 Phone (231) 893-1415 Fax (231) 894-3700 www. c:<1•lton-creek.com • 	On February l 7'h a counterweight customer rescheduled $300K in castings from February and March lO April and May deliveries (30 to 60 days out). • 	On February 24'h thi., same counterweight customer pushed out delivery on $4 7K of castings, from March and April to May and June deliveries (30 to 60 days out). • 	On March 3rd a major crane customer placed $806K in castings un hold, then rescheduled 1hilivery for June. • 	On March 5'11the same crane customer canceled $704K in orders originally scheduled for delivery in July. • 	Also on March 5'"a counterweight customer rescheduled $98K in orders from April and May to May and June delivery dates (30 to 60 days out). • 	On March 9th a crane customer rescheduled $125K in orders from June to a July delivery. • 	On March 9th and 1 o'"11machine tool customer reduced future orders by$ l .28MM. • 	On March 13•h a counterweight customer rescheduled $ 127K in orders from March to June and July delivery dates. During lhe last two weeks of March, we had numerous conversations with customers ai;king for verification of order quantities and delivery dates. We also inquired whether customers with multiple suppliers could transfer volume from other suppliers to Carlton Creek Ironworks. In addition we attempted to get our customers to pull orders forward into the 2"" quarter for production. Based on the information we obtained, we were able to model costing and two possible production schedules. Unfortunately the cost modeling verified that 2nd quarter sales are off 75% from 4th quarter 2008 and the entire 2•d quarter does not have the production volume required to operate the plant. As a result, the temporary employee layoffs have now been extended. On April 2, 2009, we met with all of our employees and with the union representing our production and maintenance employees to inform them that th~ layoffs were now indefinite. Carlton Creek will continue to work to preserve its existing orders and generate new business. If we are successful in putting together a sufficient volume of business, we will re.start our Rothbury facility and recall as many employees as we can. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts, the layoffs will continue and may extend beyond the time frames which constitute an "employment loss" under WARN. Because of the fluidity of our situation and the uncertainties associated with the economy, we arc providing you with this conditional WARN notice at this time. We sincerely regret that the unexpected changes in our situation made additional or advance notice impossible. At present, 207 employees are temporarily laid off without any definite return to work date. We have not closed any Michigan facilities and do not intend to. Attached is a list of job titles of employees affected by this action, the number of affected employees in each job, and a schedule ~etting forth how the layoffs (lccurred. Certain affected production and maintenance employees are represented by the Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics and Allit:d Workers International Union and its Local Union 421. Employees havecertain bumping rights under the collective bargaining agreement between Carlton Creek and the GMP Union, although the parties have agreed to suspend those rights under the current circumstances. Carlton Creek sincerely hnpes that employees will be recalled hefore their layoffs would constitute an "employment loss" under WARN. We will continue exploring opportunities with our existing customers, pursuing new customers, a11d looking for new markets for alternative products th.at can be processed at the Rothbury facility. If we are successful in this regard, the Company believes it can reduce the number of employees affected by these changes. As noted above, if we arc unsuccessful, the duration of the temporary layoffs will be further extended. Regardle,s {>f what happens, Carlton Creek will attempt to handle things in an orderly manner and will meet with representatives of the Union to di~cuss this situalioll as appropriate and necessary. The names and addresses of the chief elected union officials appear at the end of this Notice. If you have any questions, please contact me at (23 l) 894-3722. R~lly, R~··A St' Pallotta President and Chief Operating Officer Carlton Creek Holdings, LLC Mr. JohnP.
