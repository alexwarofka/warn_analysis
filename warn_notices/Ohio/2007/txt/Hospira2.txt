of 1988 which requires employers to give official notice to certain government units and/or officials of a 
plant closure. 
As you know, earlier this year Hospira determined that there was excess capacity within its medical 
device manufacturing business. The Company carefully analyzed this situation and its available options, 
and it is with regret that I must report to you that the company announced on February 1, 2006 to 
permanently close its Ashland, Ohio facility. As a result, we will be permanently laying off approximately 
450 employees between August 1, 2006 and July 31, 2007. At this juncture, the following positions are 
being eliminated beginning May 15, 2007. 
Transfer Press Operator (8) Miscellaneous Molder (4) Trim/Inspector (5) Customer Service Tech ( 1) Miscellaneous latex ( 4) Inspect/ Assembler (2) "~ ~*' __ ( 41 )------~----á-á ___ServiceJ~!:¤2Ej~------M.ain~nan~e -~-cc.,,,.o_u_n"'ta.,._n_t-'(-'1 --áw-w, _ Plastic Machine Operator (4) Store Room Coordinator (1) Quality Assurance (7) Ceco Operator (2) Jones Machine Operator (2) Housekeeper (I) Pack Rapid (I) Die Out Operator (3) Miscellaneous Material Handler (3) Supervisors (5) Mfg.

bargaining unit employees' bumping rights are governed by seniority provisions contained in a collective 
bargaining agreement. The representative of this Union is Kurt Brown. His address is I 79 Holbrook 
A venue, Ashland, Ohio 44805. 
The Company has negotiated a severance agreement covering bargaining unit employees which includes 
severance pay and continuation of health insurance benefits. It is our hope that these benefits will lessen 
the impact of this plant closing on individual employees and on the community as a whole. Should you 
have any questions please feel free to contact the undersigned.
